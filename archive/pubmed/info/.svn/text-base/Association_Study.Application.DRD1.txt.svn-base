TI  - Dopamine D1 receptor gene polymorphism is associated with essential
      hypertension.
PG  - 183-6
AB  - Dopamine has been shown to influence renal sodium excretion through a
      direct interaction with the dopamine receptor (DR). The dopamine D1
      receptor (DRD1) has been localized to the proximal tubules and is known to
      increase sodium excretion by inhibiting Na-H exchanger and Na,K-ATPase
      activity. Defective renal dopamine production and/or DR function have been
      reported in essential hypertension (EH) as well as in genetic models of
      animal hypertension. With a restriction fragment length polymorphism of
      the DRD1 gene, we performed an association study in patients with EH. One
      hundred thirty-one subjects with EH and 136 age-matched normotensive (NT)
      controls were studied. Polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify the
      A-48G polymorphic site in the DRD1 gene, and restriction analysis of the
      polymerase chain reaction product was used to score the A and G alleles.
      The allele frequencies in the EH group and NT group were then compared.
      The G allele was observed more frequently in the EH group than in the NT
      group, and the allele frequencies in the 2 groups differed significantly
      (chi(2)=6.5, P=0.01). Multiple logistic linear regression analysis
      revealed that the genotype frequencies of A/A, A/G, and G/G differed
      significantly (odds ratio=2.1; 95% CI=1.19 to 3.66) between the EH and NT
      groups. EH patients who possess the G allele had a higher diastolic blood
      pressure than those lacking the G allele (P<0.01). Thus, the alleles
      detected by this restriction fragment length polymorphism in the DRD1 gene
      are associated with EH, and they appear to influence the diastolic blood
      pressure of Japanese EH patients.

TI  - Linkage disequilibrium between dopamine D1 receptor gene (DRD1) and
      bipolar disorder.
PG  - 1144-50
AB  - BACKGROUND: Based on the dopamine hypothesis, the dopamine D1 receptor
      gene (DRD1) is considered to be a good candidate gene for bipolar disorder
      (BP). METHODS: In our study, three polymorphisms of the DRD1 gene,
      -800T/C, -48A/G, and 1403T/C, were analyzed in 286 BP trios. Both the
      transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) and haplotype TDT were performed on
      the genotype data to test for the presence of linkage disequilibrium
      between DRD1 and bipolar disorder. With the extended transmission
      disequilibrium test (ETDT), we also calculated the maternal transmission
      and paternal transmission for each allele. RESULTS: Although no
      association was found for each individual polymorphism, there is a
      significant association between DRD1 and BP for haplotype TDT analysis
      (chi(2) = 16.068, df = 3, p =.0011). CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate
      that DRD1 may play a role in the etiology of bipolar disorder.

TI  - 5' UTR polymorphism of dopamine receptor D1 (DRD1) associated with
      severity and temperament of alcoholism.
PG  - 1135-41
AB  - Multiple dopamine receptors in the dopaminergic system may be prime
      candidates for genetic influence on alcohol abuse and dependence due to
      their involvement in reward and reinforcing mechanisms. Genetic
      polymorphisms in dopamine receptor genes are believed to influence the
      development and/or severity of alcoholism. To examine the genetic effects
      of the Dopamine Receptor D1 (DRD) gene family (DRD1-DRD5) in the Korean
      population, 11 polymorphisms in the DRD gene family were genotyped and
      analyzed in 535 alcohol-dependent subjects and 273 population controls.
      Although none of the polymorphisms of DRD1-5 genes were found to be
      associated with the risk of alcoholism, one 5' UTR polymorphism in the
      DRD1 (DRD1-48A>G) gene was significantly associated with severity of
      alcohol-related problem, as measured by the Alcohol Use Disorders
      Identification Test (AUDIT) in a gene dose-dependent manner, i.e., 24.37
      (+/-8.19) among patients with -48A/A genotype, 22.37 (+/-9.49) among those
      with -48A/G genotype, and 17.38 (+/-8.28) among those with -48G/G genotype
      (P=0.002). The genetic effects of DRD1-48A>G were further analyzed with
      other phenotypes among alcohol-dependent subjects. Interestingly, the
      DRD1-48A>A genotype was also found to be associated with novelty seeking
      (NC), harm avoidance (HA), and persistence (P) (P =0.01, 0.02, and 0.003,
      respectively). The information derived from this study could be valuable
      for understanding the genetic factors involved in alcoholic phenotypes and
      genetic distribution of the DRD gene family, and could facilitate further
      investigation in other ethnic groups.

TI  - Significant association of DRD1 with nicotine dependence.
PG  - 133-40
AB  - Epidemiologic studies have strongly implicated genetics in smoking
      behavior. Genes in the dopaminergic system, which mediates the reinforcing
      and dependence-producing properties of nicotine, are plausible candidates
      for roles in nicotine dependence (ND). In this study, we examined five
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within or near the dopamine D(1)
      receptor gene (DRD1) for their association with ND, which was assessed by
      smoking quantity (SQ), the Heaviness of Smoking Index (HSI), and the
      Fagerstrom Test for ND (FTND). The samples were obtained from 2,037
      participants representing 200 European American (EA) and 402 African
      American (AA) families. Although we found significant associations of SNPs
      rs265973, rs686, and rs4532 in the AA sample; of rs4532 in the EA sample;
      and of rs265975, rs686, and rs4532 in the pooled sample with various ND
      measures, only the association of rs686 in the AA sample and of rs686 and
      rs4532 in the pooled sample remained significant after correction for
      multiple testing. Haplotype-based association analysis revealed that
      haplotype C-T-A, formed by rs265973, rs265975, and rs686, was
      significantly associated with all three ND measures in both the AA and the
      pooled sample. Another haplotype, T-A-T, formed by rs265975, rs686, and
      rs4532, showed a significant association with FTND in the pooled sample.
      Furthermore, in a luciferase reporter assay, rs686, located in the 3'
      untranslated region, caused differential luciferase activities, indicating
      that rs686 is a functional polymorphism affecting expression of DRD1.

TI  - A haplotype of the DRD1 gene is associated with alcohol dependence.
PG  - 567-72
AB  - BACKGROUND: The D1 dopamine receptor has been involved in a number of
      brain functions, including motor control, inattentive symptoms and reward
      and reinforcement mechanisms. Indeed, DRD1 antagonists may reduce
      cocaine-seeking behavior and the acquisition of cocaine-cue associations.
      The D1.1/r4532 marker of the DRD1 gene has been associated with a large
      set of phenotypes including addictive behaviors, but none with alcohol
      dependence per se. METHODS: We analyzed a population of 134 patients with
      alcohol dependence, also assessing more homogeneous (severe) phenotypes,
      comparing this sample with a healthy control population, assessing two
      SNPs within the DRD1 gene in order to depict the role of DRD1
      polymorphisms and haplotypes. RESULTS: The T allele of the rs686
      polymorphism within DRD1 gene was significantly more frequent in patients
      with alcohol dependence (p = 0.0008), with a larger excess for patients
      with severe dependence (p = 6 x 10(-6)), and even more for patients with
      severe complications such as withdrawal seizures (p = 7 x 10(-7)). A
      specific haplotype rs686*T-rs4532*G within the DRD1 gene was significantly
      more precisely associated with alcohol dependence in our sample (p = 5 x
      10(-6)). CONCLUSIONS: Even though chance finding cannot be ruled out,
      convergent evidence is given that the DRD1 gene is a susceptibility gene
      in alcohol dependence, regarding the fact that relying on more homogeneous
      phenotypes (i.e., more severe patients) and more informative genetic
      markers (i.e., haplotypes) reinforce the initial association.

TI  - Two distinct promoters drive transcription of the human D1A dopamine
      receptor gene.
PG  - 25292-9
AB  - The human D1A dopamine receptor gene has a GC-rich, TATA-less promoter
      located upstream of a small, noncoding exon 1, which is separated from the
      coding exon 2 by a 116-base pair (bp)-long intron. Serial 3'-deletions of
      the 5'-noncoding region of this gene, including the intron and 5'-end of
      exon 2, resulted in 80 and 40% decrease in transcriptional activity of the
      upstream promoter in two D1A-expressing neuroblastoma cell lines, SK-N-MC
      and NS20Y, respectively. To investigate the function of this region, the
      intron and 245 bp at the 5'-end of exon 2 were investigated. Transient
      expression analyses using various chloramphenicol acetyltransferase
      constructs showed that the transcriptional activity of the intron is
      higher than that of the upstream promoter by 12-fold in SK-N-MC cells and
      by 5.5-fold in NS20Y cells in an orientation-dependent manner, indicating
      that the D1A intron is a strong promoter. Primer extension and
      ribonuclease protection assays revealed that transcription driven by the
      intron promoter is initiated at the junction of intron and exon 2 and at a
      cluster of nucleotides located 50 bp downstream from this junction. The
      same transcription start sites are utilized by the chloramphenicol
      acetyltransferase constructs employed in transfections as well as by the
      D1A gene expressed within the human caudate. The relative abundance of D1A
      transcripts originating from the upstream promoter compared with those
      transcribed from the intron promoter is 1.5-2.9 times in SK-N-MC cells and
      2 times in the human caudate. Transcript stability studies in SK-N-MC
      cells revealed that longer D1A mRNA molecules containing exon 1 are
      degraded 1.8 times faster than shorter transcripts lacking exon 1.
      Although gel mobility shift assay could not detect DNA-protein interaction
      at the D1A intron, competitive co-transfection using the intron as
      competitor confirmed the presence of trans-acting factors at the intron.
      These data taken together indicate that the human D1A gene has two
      functional TATA-less promoters, both in D1A expressing cultured
      neuroblastoma cells and in the human striatum.

TI  - Linkage and association of adrenergic and dopamine receptor genes in the
      distal portion of the long arm of chromosome 5 with systolic blood
      pressure variation.
PG  - 1379-83
AB  - Elevated blood pressure is an important risk factor for renal-, cerebro-
      and cardiovascular diseases. We used an efficient discordant sib-pair
      ascertainment scheme to investigate the impact of the distal end of the
      long arm of human chromosome 5 (chromosomal region 5q31.1-qter) containing
      genes for the alpha1B and beta2 adrenergic receptors and the dopamine
      receptor type 1A on variation of systolic blood pressure in young
      Caucasians. We measured eight highly polymorphic markers spanning this
      positional candidate gene-rich region in 427 individuals from 55
      three-generation pedigrees containing 69 discordant sibling pairs, and
      calculated multipoint identity by descent (MIBD) probabilities. The
      results of genetic linkage and association tests indicate that the region
      between markers D5S2093 and D5S462 is significantly linked to one or more
      polymorphic genes influencing interindividual variation in systolic blood
      pressure levels. Since the alpha1B adrenergic receptor and dopamine
      receptor type 1A genes are located close to these markers, these data
      suggest that genetic variation in one or both of these G protein-coupled
      receptors, which participate in the control of vascular tone, plays an
      important role in influencing interindividual variation in systolic blood
      pressure levels.
