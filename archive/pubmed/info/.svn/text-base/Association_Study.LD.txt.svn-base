TI  - Comparison of linkage-disequilibrium methods for localization of genes
      influencing quantitative traits in humans.
PG  - 1194-205
AB  - Linkage disequilibrium has been used to help in the identification of
      genes predisposing to certain qualitative diseases. Although several
      linkage-disequilibrium tests have been developed for localization of genes
      influencing quantitative traits, these tests have not been thoroughly
      compared with one another. In this report we compare, under a variety of
      conditions, several different linkage-disequilibrium tests for
      identification of loci affecting quantitative traits. These tests use
      either single individuals or parent-child trios. When we compared tests
      with equal samples, we found that the truncated measured allele (TMA) test
      was the most powerful. The trait allele frequencies, the stringency of
      sample ascertainment, the number of marker alleles, and the linked genetic
      variance affected the power, but the presence of polygenes did not. When
      there were more than two trait alleles at a locus in the population, power
      to detect disequilibrium was greatly diminished. The presence of unlinked
      disequilibrium (D'*) increased the false-positive error rates of
      disequilibrium tests involving single individuals but did not affect the
      error rates of tests using family trios. The increase in error rates was
      affected by the stringency of selection, the trait allele frequency, and
      the linked genetic variance but not by polygenic factors. In an
      equilibrium population, the TMA test is most powerful, but, when adjusted
      for the presence of admixture, Allison test 3 becomes the most powerful
      whenever D'*>.15.

TI  - The transmission/disequilibrium test for linkage on the X chromosome.
PG  - 1158-60
AB  - The transmission/disequilibrium test (TDT), which detects linkage between
      a marker and disease loci in the presence of linkage disequilibrium, was
      introduced by Spielman et al. The original TDT requires families in which
      the genotypes are known for both parents and for at least one affected
      offspring, and this limits its applicability to diseases with late onset.
      The sib-TDT, or S-TDT, which utilizes families with affected and
      unaffected siblings, was introduced as an alternative method, by Spielman
      and Ewens, and the TDT and S-TDT can be combined in an overall test (i.e.,
      a combined-TDT, or C-TDT). The TDT statistics described so far are for
      autosomal chromosomes. We have extended these TDT methods to test for
      linkage between X-linked markers and diseases that affect either males
      only or both sexes. For diseases of late onset, when parental genotypes
      are often unavailable, the X-linkage C-TDT may allow for more power than
      is provided by the X-linkage TDT alone.

TI  - Multipoint linkage-disequilibrium-mapping approach based on the
      case-parent trio design.
PG  - 937-50
AB  - In the present study we propose a multipoint approach, for the mapping of
      genes, that is based on the case-parent trio design. We first derive an
      expression for the expected preferential-allele-transmission statistics
      for transmission, from either parent to an affected child, for an
      arbitrary location within a chromosomal region demarcated by several
      genetic markers. No assumption about genetic mechanism is needed in this
      derivation, beyond the assumption that no more than one disease gene lies
      in the region framed by the markers. When one builds on this
      representation, the way in which one may maximize the genetic information
      from multiple markers becomes obvious. This proposed method differs from
      the popular transmission/disequilibrium test (TDT) approach for fine
      mapping, in the following ways: First, in contrast with the TDT approach,
      all markers contribute information, regardless of whether the parents are
      heterozygous at any one marker, and incomplete trio data can be utilized
      in our approach. Second, rather than performing the TDT at each marker
      separately, we propose a single test statistic that follows a chi(2)
      distribution with 1 df, under the null hypothesis of no linkage or linkage
      disequilibrium to the region. Third, in the presence of linkage evidence,
      we offer a means to estimate the location of the disease locus along with
      its sampling uncertainty. We illustrate the proposed method with data from
      a family study of asthma, conducted in Barbados.

TI  - Genetic linkage and transmission disequilibrium of marker haplotypes at
      chromosome 1q41 in human systemic lupus erythematosus.
PG  - 299-305
AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease
      characterized by the production of autoantibodies to a wide range of
      self-antigens. Recent genome screens have implicated numerous chromosomal
      regions as potential SLE susceptibility loci. Among these, the 1q41 locus
      is of particular interest, because evidence for linkage has been found in
      several independent SLE family collections. Additionally, the 1q41 locus
      appears to be syntenic with a susceptibility interval identified in the
      NZM2410 mouse model for SLE. Here, we report the results of genotyping of
      11 microsatellite markers within the 1q41 region in 210 SLE sibpair and
      122 SLE trio families. These data confirm the modest evidence for linkage
      at 1q41 in our family collection (LOD = 1.21 at marker D1S2616). Evidence
      for significant linkage disequilibrium in this interval was also found.
      Multiple markers in the region exhibit transmission disequilibrium, with
      the peak single marker multiallelic linkage disequilibrium noted at D1S490
      (pedigree disequilibrium test [PDT] global P value = 0.0091). Two- and
      three-marker haplotypes from the 1q41 region similarly showed strong
      transmission distortion in the collection of 332 SLE families. The finding
      of linkage together with significant transmission disequilibrium provides
      strong evidence for a susceptibility locus at 1q41 in human SLE.

      polymorphisms.
PG  - 634-46
AB  - Autoimmune, inflammatory, and infectious diseases present a major burden
      to human health and are frequently associated with loci in the human major
      histocompatibility complex (MHC). Here, we report a high-resolution (1.9
      kb) linkage-disequilibrium (LD) map of a 4.46-Mb fragment containing the
      MHC in U.S. pedigrees with northern and western European ancestry
      collected by the Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH) and the
      first generation of haplotype tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms
      (tagSNPs) that provide up to a fivefold increase in genotyping efficiency
      for all future MHC-linked disease-association studies. The data confirm
      previously identified recombination hotspots in the class II region and
      allow the prediction of numerous novel hotspots in the class I and class
      III regions. The region of longest LD maps outside the classic MHC to the
      extended class I region spanning the MHC-linked olfactory-receptor gene
      cluster. The extended haplotype homozygosity analysis for recent positive
      selection shows that all 14 outlying haplotype variants map to a single
      extended haplotype, which most commonly bears HLA-DRB1*1501. The SNP data,
      haplotype blocks, and tagSNPs analysis reported here have been entered
      into a multidimensional Web-based database (GLOVAR), where they can be
      accessed and viewed in the context of relevant genome annotation. This LD
      map allowed us to give coordinates for the extremely variable LD structure
      underlying the MHC.

TI  - The effects of genotype-dependent recombination, and transmission
      asymmetry, on linkage disequilibrium.
PG  - 2001-5
AB  - A recent sperm-typing study by Jeffreys and Neumann suggested that
      recombination rates in different individuals at the DNA2 recombination
      hotspot appeared to be highly dependent on their genotype at a particular
      A/G SNP, FG11. Specifically, individuals who carried at least one copy of
      the A allele at this SNP exhibited rates of crossover considerably higher
      than those of individuals with no copies. Further, recombinant sperm from
      heterozygous individuals showed a preferential tendency to carry the G
      allele. We consider the effects of these phenomena on patterns of linkage
      disequilibrium and find them to be more subtle than might have been
      expected. In particular, our analysis suggests that, perhaps surprisingly,
      patterns of LD among chromosomes carrying the "hot" allele (in this case,
      A) will typically be similar to those among chromosomes carrying the
      "cold" allele (G).

TI  - Evaluation of linkage disequilibrium and its effect on non-parametric
      multipoint linkage analysis using two high density single-nucleotide
      polymorphism mapping panels.
PG  - S85
AB  - ABSTRACT : Genotype data from the Illumina Linkage III SNP panel (n =
      4,720 SNPs) and the Affymetrix 10 k mapping array (n = 11,120 SNPs) were
      used to test the effects of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between SNPs in a
      linkage analysis in the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism
      pedigree collection (143 pedigrees; 1,614 individuals). The average r2
      between adjacent markers across the genetic map was 0.099 +/- 0.003 in the
      Illumina III panel and 0.17 +/- 0.003 in the Affymetrix 10 k array. In
      order to determine the effect of LD between marker loci in a nonparametric
      multipoint linkage analysis, markers in strong LD with another marker (r2
      > 0.40) were removed (n = 471 loci in the Illumina panel; n = 1,804 loci
      in the Affymetrix panel) and the linkage analysis results were compared to
      the results using the entire marker sets. In all analyses using the ALDX1
      phenotype, 8 linkage regions on 5 chromosomes (2, 7, 10, 11, X) were
      detected (peak markers p < 0.01), and the Illumina panel detected an
      additional region on chromosome 6. Analysis of the same pedigree set and
      ALDX1 phenotype using short tandem repeat markers (STRs) resulted in 3
      linkage regions on 3 chromosomes (peak markers p < 0.01). These results
      suggest that in this pedigree set, LD between loci with spacing similar to
      the SNP panels tested may not significantly affect the overall detection
      of linkage regions in a genome scan. Moreover, since the data quality and
      information content are greatly improved in the SNP panels over STR
      genotyping methods, new linkage regions may be identified due to higher
      information content and data quality in a dense SNP linkage panel.

TI  - The quantitative trait linkage disequilibrium test: a more powerful
      alternative to the quantitative transmission disequilibrium test for use
      in the absence of population stratification.
PG  - S91
AB  - ABSTRACT : Linkage analysis based on identity-by-descent allele-sharing
      can be used to identify a chromosomal region harboring a quantitative
      trait locus (QTL), but lacks the resolution required for gene
      identification. Consequently, linkage disequilibrium (association)
      analysis is often employed for fine-mapping. Variance-components based
      combined linkage and association analysis for quantitative traits in sib
      pairs, in which association is modeled as a mean effect and linkage is
      modeled in the covariance structure has been extended to general pedigrees
      (quantitative transmission disequilibrium test, QTDT). The QTDT approach
      accommodates data not only from parents and siblings, but also from all
      available relatives. QTDT is also robust to population stratification.
      However, when population stratification is absent, it is possible to
      utilize even more information, namely the additional information contained
      in the founder genotypes. In this paper, we introduce a simple
      modification of the allelic transmission scoring method used in the QTDT
      that results in a more powerful test of linkage disequilibrium, but is
      only applicable in the absence of population stratification. This test,
      the quantitative trait linkage disequilibrium (QTLD) test, has been
      incorporated into a new procedure in the statistical genetics computer
      package SOLAR. We apply this procedure in a linkage/association analysis
      of an electrophysiological measurement previously shown to be related to
      alcoholism. We also demonstrate by simulation the increase in power
      obtained with the QTLD test, relative to the QTDT, when a true association
      exists between a marker and a QTL.

TI  - Multipoint linkage-disequilibrium mapping with haplotype-block structure.
PG  - 112-25
AB  - The HapMap Project is providing a great deal of new information on
      high-resolution haplotype structure in various human populations. This
      information has the potential to greatly increase the power of association
      mapping for a fixed amount of genotyping. A number of methods have been
      proposed for the identification of haplotype blocks, common haplotypes,
      and tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Here, we build on this work
      by developing novel methods for case-control multipoint
      linkage-disequilibrium (LD) mapping that gain power and speed by making
      explicit use of the inferred block structure. Specifically, we developed a
      virtual-variant approach that uses the haplotype-block information to
      greatly increase power for detection of untyped common variants associated
      with a trait. Because full multipoint LD mapping can be slow, we exploited
      the haplotype-block information to develop a fast single-block multipoint
      mapping method. Our methods are appropriate for genotype data and take
      into account the uncertainty in phase. We describe the methods in the
      context of case-parents trios, although they are also applicable to
      unrelated cases and controls. Our simulations indicate that the most
      important gains from taking into account the haplotype-block structure at
      the analysis stage of multipoint LD mapping come from (1) greatly
      increased power to detect association with untyped variants and (2)
      greatly improved localization of untyped variants associated with the
      trait. More-modest gains are obtained in improving power to detect
      association with a variant that is typed with a moderate amount of missing
      data. The methods are applied to a Crohn disease data set.

TI  - Linkage disequilibrium of evolutionarily conserved regions in the human
      genome.
PG  - 326
AB  - BACKGROUND: The strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) recently found in genic
      or exonic regions of the human genome demonstrated that LD can be
      increased by evolutionary mechanisms that select for functionally
      important loci. This suggests that LD might be stronger in regions
      conserved among species than in non-conserved regions, since regions
      exposed to natural selection tend to be conserved. To assess this
      hypothesis, we used genome-wide polymorphism data from the HapMap project
      and investigated LD within DNA sequences conserved between the human and
      mouse genomes. RESULTS: Unexpectedly, we observed that LD was
      significantly weaker in conserved regions than in non-conserved regions.
      To investigate why, we examined sequence features that may distort the
      relationship between LD and conserved regions. We found that interspersed
      repeats, and not other sequence features, were associated with the weak LD
      tendency in conserved regions. To appropriately understand the
      relationship between LD and conserved regions, we removed the effect of
      repetitive elements and found that the high degree of sequence
      conservation was strongly associated with strong LD in coding regions but
      not with that in non-coding regions. CONCLUSION: Our work demonstrates
      that the degree of sequence conservation does not simply increase LD as
      predicted by the hypothesis. Rather, it implies that purifying selection
      changes the polymorphic patterns of coding sequences but has little
      influence on the patterns of functional units such as regulatory elements
      present in non-coding regions, since the former are generally restricted
      by the constraint of maintaining a functional protein product across
      multiple exons while the latter may exist more as individually isolated
      units.

TI  - Transmission test for linkage disequilibrium: the insulin gene region and
      insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM).
PG  - 506-16
AB  - A population association has consistently been observed between
      insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and the "class 1" alleles of
      the region of tandem-repeat DNA (5' flanking polymorphism [5'FP]) adjacent
      to the insulin gene on chromosome 11p. This finding suggests that the
      insulin gene region contains a gene or genes contributing to IDDM
      susceptibility. However, several studies that have sought to show linkage
      with IDDM by testing for cosegregation in affected sib pairs have failed
      to find evidence for linkage. As means for identifying genes for complex
      diseases, both the association and the affected-sib-pairs approaches have
      limitations. It is well known that population association between a
      disease and a genetic marker can arise as an artifact of population
      structure, even in the absence of linkage. On the other hand, linkage
      studies with modest numbers of affected sib pairs may fail to detect
      linkage, especially if there is linkage heterogeneity. We consider an
      alternative method to test for linkage with a genetic marker when
      population association has been found. Using data from families with at
      least one affected child, we evaluate the transmission of the associated
      marker allele from a heterozygous parent to an affected offspring. This
      approach has been used by several investigators, but the statistical
      properties of the method as a test for linkage have not been investigated.
      In the present paper we describe the statistical basis for this
      "transmission test for linkage disequilibrium"
      (transmission/disequilibrium test [TDT]). We then show the relationship of
      this test to tests of cosegregation that are based on the proportion of
      haplotypes or genes identical by descent in affected sibs. The TDT
      provides strong evidence for linkage between the 5'FP and susceptibility
      to IDDM. The conclusions from this analysis apply in general to the study
      of disease associations, where genetic markers are usually closely linked
      to candidate genes. When a disease is found to be associated with such a
      marker, the TDT may detect linkage even when haplotype-sharing tests do
      not.

TI  - Linkage disequilibrium between an allele at the dopamine D4 receptor locus
      and Tourette syndrome, by the transmission-disequilibrium test.
PG  - 644-52
AB  - Dopaminergic abnormalities are implicated in the pathogenesis of Tourette
      syndrome (TS) and chronic multiple tics. We used the
      transmission-disequilibrium test (TDT) method to test for linkage
      disequilibrium between a specific allele (the seven-repeat allele
      (DRD4*7R) of the exon 3 VNTR polymorphic site) at the D4 dopamine receptor
      locus (DRD4) and expression of chronic multiple tics and TS. This
      particular allele had been shown in functional studies to have different
      binding properties compared with the other common alleles in this DRD4
      polymorphic system. We studied 64 family trios (consisting of an affected
      person and two parents, at least one heterozygous for DRD4*7R), including
      12 nuclear family trios and 52 trios from four large TS kindreds. The
      DRD4*7R allele was transmitted significantly more frequently than expected
      (chi 2 TDT ranging from 8.47 [P < .004] to 10.80 [P = .001], depending on
      breadth of disease definition and inclusion or exclusion of inferred
      genotypes). Confirmation of this finding will depend on either replication
      in other samples or the identification of a transmitted functional
      mutation within this sample.

TI  - Linkage-disequilibrium mapping of autistic disorder, with 15q11-13
      markers.
PG  - 1077-83
AB  - Autistic disorder is a complex genetic disease. Because of previous
      reports of individuals with autistic disorder with duplications of the
      Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome critical region, we screened several
      markers across the 15q11-13 region, for linkage disequilibrium. One
      hundred forty families, consisting predominantly of a child with autistic
      disorder and both parents, were studied. Genotyping was performed by use
      of multiplex PCR and capillary electrophoresis. Two children were
      identified who had interstitial chromosome 15 duplications and were
      excluded from further linkage-disequilibrium analysis. Use of the
      multiallelic transmission-disequilibrium test (MTDT), for nine loci on
      15q11-13, revealed linkage disequilibrium between autistic disorder and a
      marker in the gamma-aminobutyric acidA receptor subunit gene, GABRB3
      155CA-2 (MTDT 28.63, 10 df, P=.0014). No evidence was found for
      parent-of-origin effects on allelic transmission. The convergence of
      GABRB3 as a positional and functional candidate along with the
      linkage-disequilibrium data suggests the need for further investigation of
      the role of GABRB3 or adjacent genes in autistic disorder.
