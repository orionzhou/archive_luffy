TI  - "Are we there yet?": Deciding when one has demonstrated specific genetic
      causation in complex diseases and quantitative traits.
PG  - 711-9
AB  - Although mathematical relationships can be proven by deductive logic,
      biological relationships can only be inferred from empirical observations.
      This is a distinct disadvantage for those of us who strive to identify the
      genes involved in complex diseases and quantitative traits. If causation
      cannot be proven, however, what does constitute sufficient evidence for
      causation? The philosopher Karl Popper said, "Our belief in a hypothesis
      can have no stronger basis than our repeated unsuccessful critical
      attempts to refute it." We believe that to establish causation, as
      scientists, we must make a serious attempt to refute our own hypotheses
      and to eliminate all known sources of bias before association becomes
      causation. In addition, we suggest that investigators must provide
      sufficient data and evidence of their unsuccessful efforts to find any
      confounding biases. In this editorial, we discuss what "causation" means
      in the context of complex diseases and quantitative traits, and we suggest
      guidelines for steps that may be taken to address possible confounders of
      association before polymorphisms may be called "causative."

TI  - Evaluating statistical significance in two-stage genomewide association
      studies.
PG  - 505-9
AB  - Genomewide association studies are being conducted to unravel the genetic
      etiology of complex human diseases. Because of cost constraints, these
      studies typically employ a two-stage design, under which a large panel of
      markers is examined in a subsample of subjects, and the most-promising
      markers are then examined in all subjects. This report describes a simple
      and efficient method to evaluate statistical significance for such genome
      studies. The proposed method, which properly accounts for the correlated
      nature of polymorphism data, provides accurate control of the overall
      false-positive rate and is substantially more powerful than the standard
      Bonferroni correction, especially when the markers are in strong linkage
      disequilibrium.
