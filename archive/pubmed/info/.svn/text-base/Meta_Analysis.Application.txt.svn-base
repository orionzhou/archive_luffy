TI  - Association between a functional catechol O-methyltransferase gene
      polymorphism and schizophrenia: meta-analysis of case-control and
      family-based studies.
PG  - 469-76
AB  - OBJECTIVE: There is strong evidence for a genetic contribution to
      schizophrenia, but efforts to identify susceptibility genes have been
      largely unsuccessful because of the low power of individual studies. The
      authors' goal was to evaluate the collective evidence for an association
      between the Val158/108Met polymorphism of the catechol O-methyltransferase
      (COMT) gene and schizophrenia. METHOD: They performed separate
      meta-analyses of existing case-control and family-based association
      studies. RESULTS: Overall, case-control studies showed no indication of an
      association between either allele and schizophrenia, and family-based
      studies found modest evidence implicating the Val allele in schizophrenia
      risk. The pooled analyses of studies from diverse geographical regions may
      have obscured ethnic differences in patterns of genetic risk for
      schizophrenia. Stratification of the studies by ethnicity of the subjects
      yielded evidence for an association with the Val allele in case-control
      studies of European samples and, especially, in family-based studies of
      European samples. Case-control and family-based studies of Asian samples
      produced mixed results and, overall, little evidence for association.
      CONCLUSIONS: The results of the two types of association studies diverged
      somewhat, but the evidence from the family-based studies, although based
      on fewer reports, may be more accurate. The Val allele may be a small but
      reliable risk factor for schizophrenia for people of European ancestry,
      but the influence of this polymorphism on risk in Asian populations
      remains unclear. These results call for more family-based studies to
      confirm the association between COMT and schizophrenia in European samples
      and to clarify its contribution to risk in Asian samples. They also
      suggest that case-control studies should use methods of genomic control to
      avoid being confounded by population stratification.

TI  - Lack of association of the COMT (Val158/108 Met) gene and schizophrenia: a
      meta-analysis of case-control studies.
PG  - 765-70
AB  - There is strong evidence for a genetic contribution to schizophrenia, but
      the contribution of individual candidate genes remains uncertain. We
      attempted to replicate a recent meta-analysis that reported an association
      of the catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT) Val allele with schizophrenia,
      and suggested that this effect may be moderated by ancestry. We included
      reports published subsequent to the original meta-analysis, and included a
      formal test of the moderating effect of ancestry in order to test whether
      the association operates differently in populations of European ancestry
      compared to populations of Asian ancestry. A corrected P-value for the 5%
      significance threshold was employed where appropriate, using Bonferroni's
      method, and studies that demonstrated departure from Hardy-Weinberg
      equilibrium among controls were excluded. When all studies were included
      in a meta-regression, there was evidence for a significant association of
      COMT Val allele frequency with schizophrenia case status and a significant
      main effect of ancestry. The interaction of COMT Val allele frequency and
      ancestry was also significant. However, when only studies that reported
      allele frequencies that did not depart significantly from Hardy-Weinberg
      equilibrium among controls were included, these effects were no longer
      significant. The results of our meta-analysis do not support an
      association between the COMT Val allele and schizophrenia case status, and
      do not support recent claims that this association may be moderated by
      ancestry.

TI  - Association of the NRG1 gene and schizophrenia: a meta-analysis.
PG  - 539-46
AB  - We investigated the association of the NRG1 gene and schizophrenia using
      meta-analytic techniques, combining all published data while restricting
      our analysis to studies investigating the most commonly reported single
      marker (SNP8NRG221533). We also investigated whether ancestry (European vs
      East Asian) and study design (family-based vs case-control) moderated any
      association. We found no evidence for an association of SNP8NRG221533 with
      schizophrenia, and significant between-study heterogeneity, which
      persisted when family-based studies were combined separately. However,
      when haplotype-based P-values were combined, there was evidence in support
      of an association of NRG1 with schizophrenia, and no evidence of
      between-study heterogeneity. Our meta-analysis provides support for the
      association of NRG1 with schizophrenia, but indicates that firmly
      establishing the role of NRG1 gene in schizophrenia by genetic association
      requires much larger sample sizes than have hitherto been reported.
      Association analyses and replications should take place at the level of
      the gene, rather than at the level of SNP, haplotype, or functional
      variant. Meta-analysis would then be carried out on the basis of the
      combination of P-values.

TI  - A common variant in the FTO gene is associated with body mass index and
      predisposes to childhood and adult obesity.
PG  - 889-94
AB  - Obesity is a serious international health problem that increases the risk
      of several common diseases. The genetic factors predisposing to obesity
      are poorly understood. A genome-wide search for type 2
      diabetes-susceptibility genes identified a common variant in the FTO (fat
      mass and obesity associated) gene that predisposes to diabetes through an
      effect on body mass index (BMI). An additive association of the variant
      with BMI was replicated in 13 cohorts with 38,759 participants. The 16% of
      adults who are homozygous for the risk allele weighed about 3 kilograms
      more and had 1.67-fold increased odds of obesity when compared with those
      not inheriting a risk allele. This association was observed from age 7
      years upward and reflects a specific increase in fat mass.

TI  - A genome-wide association study of type 2 diabetes in Finns detects
      multiple susceptibility variants.
PG  - 1341-5
AB  - Identifying the genetic variants that increase the risk of type 2 diabetes
      (T2D) in humans has been a formidable challenge. Adopting a genome-wide
      association strategy, we genotyped 1161 Finnish T2D cases and 1174 Finnish
      normal glucose-tolerant (NGT) controls with >315,000 single-nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs) and imputed genotypes for an additional >2 million
      autosomal SNPs. We carried out association analysis with these SNPs to
      identify genetic variants that predispose to T2D, compared our T2D
      association results with the results of two similar studies, and genotyped
      80 SNPs in an additional 1215 Finnish T2D cases and 1258 Finnish NGT
      controls. We identify T2D-associated variants in an intergenic region of
      chromosome 11p12, contribute to the identification of T2D-associated
      variants near the genes IGF2BP2 and CDKAL1 and the region of CDKN2A and
      CDKN2B, and confirm that variants near TCF7L2, SLC30A8, HHEX, FTO, PPARG,
      and KCNJ11 are associated with T2D risk. This brings the number of T2D
      loci now confidently identified to at least 10.

TI  - Association study between the dystrobrevin binding protein 1 gene (DTNBP1)
      and schizophrenia: a meta-analysis.
PG  - 112-8
AB  - Positional, functional and association studies have strongly implicated
      the dystrobrevin binding protein 1 gene (DTNBP1) as a promising novel
      candidate gene for schizophrenia. Since the first association study was
      reported, there have been many attempts to replicate it. However the
      results have been mixed and these subsequent studies have produced
      negative as well as positive results. To reconcile these conflicting
      findings and to give a comprehensive picture of the relationship of DTNBP1
      and schizophrenia, the current meta-analysis combined all published
      association studies involving nine polymorphisms up to May 2006. The
      results (12 studies including 3429 cases, 3376 controls and 721 trios)
      showed that there were five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with p
      values < 0.05, however, sensitivity analyses showed that only one SNP was
      consistent across all nine studies (four of the five SNPs became
      non-significant after removal of one study), indicating that one study may
      cause the association findings for each of these four SNPs. In conclusion,
      there is only a weak association of one SNP in DTNBP1 with schizophrenia,
      which is not significant after multiple testing.
