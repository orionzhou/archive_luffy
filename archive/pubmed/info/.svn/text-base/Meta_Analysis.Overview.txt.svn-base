TI  - Methods for meta-analysis in genetic association studies: a review of
      their potential and pitfalls.
PG  - 1-14
AB  - Meta-analysis offers the opportunity to combine evidence from
      retrospectively accumulated or prospectively generated data. Meta-analyses
      may provide summary estimates and can help in detecting and addressing
      potential inconsistency between the combined datasets. Application of
      meta-analysis in genetic associations presents considerable potential and
      several pitfalls. In this review, we present basic principles of
      meta-analytic methods, adapted for human genome epidemiology. We describe
      issues that arise in the retrospective or the prospective collection of
      relevant data through various sources, common traps to consider in the
      appraisal of evidence and potential biases that may interfere. We describe
      the relative merits and caveats for common methods used to trace
      inconsistency across studies along with possible reasons for
      non-replication of proposed associations. Different statistical models may
      be employed to combine data and some common misconceptions may arise in
      the process. Several meta-analysis diagnostics are often applied or
      misapplied in the literature, and we comment on their use and limitations.
      An alternative to overcome limitations arising from retrospective
      combination of data from published studies is to create networks of
      research teams working in the same field and perform collaborative
      meta-analyses of individual participant data, ideally on a prospective
      basis. We discuss the advantages and the challenges inherent in such
      collaborative approaches. Meta-analysis can be a useful tool in dissecting
      the genetics of complex diseases and traits, provided its methods are
      properly applied and interpreted.
