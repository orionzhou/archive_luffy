TI  - Genetic evidence for larger African population size during recent human
      evolution.
PG  - 251-60
AB  - Genetic evidence suggests that the long-term average effective size of
      sub-Saharan Africa is larger than other geographic regions. A method is
      described that allows estimation of relative long-term regional population
      sizes. This method is applied to 60 microsatellite DNA loci from a sample
      of 72 sub-Saharan Africans, 63 East Asians, and 120 Europeans. Average
      heterozygosity is significantly higher in the sub-Saharan African sample.
      Expected heterozygosity was computed for each region and locus using a
      population genetic model based on the null hypothesis of equal long-term
      population sizes. Average residual heterozygosity is significantly higher
      in the sub-Saharan African sample, indicating that African population size
      was larger than other regions during recent human evolution. The best fit
      of the model is with relative population weights of 0.73 for sub-Saharan
      Africa, 0.09 for East Asia, and 0.18 for Europe. These results are similar
      to those obtained using craniometric variation for these three geographic
      regions. These results, combined with inferences from other genetic
      studies, support a major role of Africa in the origin of modern humans. It
      is less clear, however, whether complete African replacement is the most
      appropriate model. An alternative is an African origin with non-African
      gene flow. While Africa is an important region in recent human evolution,
      it is not clear whether the gene pool of our species is completely out of
      Africa or predominately out of Africa.

TI  - Microsatellite evolution in modern humans: a comparison of two data sets
      from the same populations.
PG  - 117-34
AB  - We genotyped 64 dinucleotide microsatellite repeats in individuals from
      populations that represent all inhabited continents. Microsatellite
      summary statistics are reported for these data, as well as for a data set
      that includes 28 out of 30 loci studied by Bowcock et al. (1994) in the
      same individuals. For both data sets, diversity statistics such as
      heterozygosity, number of alleles per locus, and number of private alleles
      per locus produced the highest values in Africans, intermediate values in
      Europeans and Asians, and low values in Americans. Evolutionary trees of
      populations based on genetic distances separated groups from different
      continents. Corresponding trees were topologically similar for the two
      data sets, with the exception that the (deltamu)2 genetic distance
      reliably distinguished groups from different continents for the larger
      data set, but not for the smaller one. Consistent with our results from
      diversity statistics and from evolutionary trees, population growth
      statistics S k and beta, which seem particularly useful for indicating
      recent and ancient population size changes, confirm a model of human
      evolution in which human populations expand in size and through space
      following the departure of a small group from Africa.

TI  - Structural analysis of insulin minisatellite alleles reveals unusually
      large differences in diversity between Africans and non-Africans.
PG  - 1273-84
AB  - The insulin minisatellite (INS VNTR) associates with susceptibility to a
      variety of diseases. We have developed a high-resolution system for
      analyzing variant repeat distributions applicable to all known
      minisatellite alleles, irrespective of size, which allows lineages of
      related alleles to be identified. This system has previously revealed
      extremely low structural diversity in the minisatellite among northern
      Europeans from the United Kingdom, with all alleles belonging to one of
      only three highly diverged lineages called "I," "IIIA," and "IIIB." To
      explore the origins of this remarkably limited lineage diversity, we have
      characterized an additional 780 alleles from three non-African and three
      African populations. In total, 22 highly diverged lineages were
      identified, with structural intermediates absent from extant populations,
      suggesting a bottleneck within the ancestry of all humans. The difference
      between levels of diversity in Africans and non-Africans is unusually
      large, with all 22 lineages identified in Africa compared with only three
      lineages seen not only in the United Kingdom but also in the other
      non-African populations. We also find evidence for overrepresentation of
      lineage I chromosomes in non-Africans. These data are consistent with a
      common out-of-Africa origin and an unusually tight bottleneck within the
      ancestry of all non-African populations, possibly combined with
      differential and positive selection for lineage I alleles in non-Africans.
      The important implications of these data for future disease-association
      studies are discussed.

TI  - Genetic structure of human populations.
PG  - 2381-5
AB  - We studied human population structure using genotypes at 377 autosomal
      microsatellite loci in 1056 individuals from 52 populations.
      Within-population differences among individuals account for 93 to 95% of
      genetic variation; differences among major groups constitute only 3 to 5%.
      Nevertheless, without using prior information about the origins of
      individuals, we identified six main genetic clusters, five of which
      correspond to major geographic regions, and subclusters that often
      correspond to individual populations. General agreement of genetic and
      predefined populations suggests that self-reported ancestry can facilitate
      assessments of epidemiological risks but does not obviate the need to use
      genetic information in genetic association studies.

TI  - Genome-wide analysis of microsatellite repeats in humans: their abundance
      and density in specific genomic regions.
PG  - R13
AB  - BACKGROUND: Simple sequence repeats (SSRs) are found in most organisms,
      and occupy about 3% of the human genome. Although it is becoming clear
      that such repeats are important in genomic organization and function and
      may be associated with disease conditions, their systematic analysis has
      not been reported. This is the first report examining the distribution and
      density of simple sequence repeats (1-6 base-pairs (bp)) in the entire
      human genome. RESULTS: The densities of SSRs across the human chromosomes
      were found to be relatively uniform. However, the overall density of SSR
      was found to be high in chromosome 19. Triplets and hexamers were more
      predominant in exonic regions compared to intronic and intergenic regions,
      except for chromosome Y. Comparison of densities of various SSRs revealed
      that whereas trimers and pentamers showed a similar pattern (500-1,000
      bp/Mb) across the chromosomes, di- tetra- and hexa-nucleotide repeats
      showed patterns of higher (2,000-3,000 bp/Mb) density. Repeats of the same
      nucleotide were found to be higher than other repeat types. Repeats of A,
      AT, AC, AAT, AAC, AAG, AGC, AAAC, AAAT, AAAG, AAGG, AGAT predominate,
      whereas repeats of C, CG, ACT, ACG, AACC, AACG, AACT, AAGC, AAGT, ACCC,
      ACCG, ACCT, CCCG and CCGG are rare. CONCLUSIONS: The overall SSR density
      was comparable in all chromosomes. The density of different repeats,
      however, showed significant variation. Tri- and hexa-nucleotide repeats
      are more abundant in exons, whereas other repeats are more abundant in
      non-coding regions.

TI  - Evidence for widespread convergent evolution around human microsatellites.
PG  - E199
AB  - Microsatellites are a major component of the human genome, and their
      evolution has been much studied. However, the evolution of microsatellite
      flanking sequences has received less attention, with reports of both high
      and low mutation rates and of a tendency for microsatellites to cluster.
      From the human genome we generated a database of many thousands of (AC)(n)
      flanking sequences within which we searched for common characteristics.
      Sequences flanking microsatellites of similar length show remarkable
      levels of convergent evolution, indicating shared mutational biases. These
      biases extend 25-50 bases either side of the microsatellite and may
      therefore affect more than 30% of the entire genome. To explore the extent
      and absolute strength of these effects, we quantified the observed
      convergence. We also compared homologous human and chimpanzee loci to look
      for evidence of changes in mutation rate around microsatellites. Most
      models of DNA sequence evolution assume that mutations are independent and
      occur randomly. Allowances may be made for sites mutating at different
      rates and for general mutation biases such as the faster rate of
      transitions over transversions. Our analysis suggests that these models
      may be inadequate, in that proximity to even very short microsatellites
      may alter the rate and distribution of mutations that occur. The elevated
      local mutation rate combined with sequence convergence, both of which we
      find evidence for, also provide a possible resolution for the apparently
      contradictory inferences of mutation rates in microsatellite flanking
      sequences.

TI  - High-resolution mapping for essential hypertension using microsatellite
      markers.
PG  - 446-52
AB  - During the past decade, considerable efforts and resources have been
      devoted to elucidating the multiple genetic and environmental determinants
      responsible for hypertension and its associated cardiovascular diseases.
      The success of positional cloning, fine mapping, and linkage analysis
      based on whole-genome screening, however, has been limited in identifying
      multiple genetic determinants affecting diseases, suggesting that new
      research strategies for genome-wide typing may be helpful. Disease
      association (case-control) studies using microsatellite markers,
      distributed every 150 kb across the human genome, may have some advantages
      over linkage, candidate, and single nucleotide polymorphism typing methods
      in terms of statistical power and linkage disequilibrium for finding
      genomic regions harboring candidate disease genes, although it is not
      proven. We have carried out genome-wide mapping using 18,977
      microsatellite markers in a Japanese population composed of 385
      hypertensive patients and 385 normotensive control subjects. Pooled sample
      analysis was conducted in a 3-stage genomic screen of 3 independent
      case-control populations, and 54 markers were extracted from the original
      18,977 microsatellite markers. As a final step, each single positive
      marker was confirmed by individual typing, and only 19 markers passed this
      test. We identified 19 allelic loci that were significantly different
      between the cases of essential hypertension and the controls.

TI  - A comprehensive analysis of microsatellite diversity in Aboriginal
      Australians.
PG  - 712-28
AB  - Indigenous Australians have a unique evolutionary history that has
      resulted in a complex system of inter and intra-tribal relationships.
      While a number of studies have examined the population genetics of
      indigenous Australians, most have used a single sample to illuminate
      details of the global dispersal of modern humans and few studies have
      focussed on the population genetic features of the widely dispersed
      communities of the indigenous population. In this study we examine the
      largest Aboriginal Australian sample yet analysed (N = 8,868) at fifteen
      hypervariable autosomal microsatellite loci. A comprehensive analysis of
      differentiation indicates different levels of heterogeneity among
      indigenous peoples from traditional regions of Aboriginal Australia. The
      most genetically differentiated populations inhabit the North of the
      country, in particular the Tiwi of Melville and Bathurst islands, Arnhem
      Land (itself divided into West and East Arnhem), and Fitzmaurice regions.
      These tribal groups are most differentiated from other Aboriginal
      Australian tribes, especially those of the Central Desert regions, and
      also show marked heterogeneity from one another. These genetic findings
      are supportive of observations of body measurements, skin colour, and
      dermatoglyphic features which also vary substantially between tribes of
      the North (e.g. Arnhem Land) and Central Australian regions and, more
      specifically, between the Tiwi and West and East Arnhem tribes. This study
      provides the most comprehensive survey of the population genetics of
      Aboriginal Australia.

TI  - Genetic variation and population structure in native Americans.
PG  - e185
AB  - We examined genetic diversity and population structure in the American
      landmass using 678 autosomal microsatellite markers genotyped in 422
      individuals representing 24 Native American populations sampled from
      North, Central, and South America. These data were analyzed jointly with
      similar data available in 54 other indigenous populations worldwide,
      including an additional five Native American groups. The Native American
      populations have lower genetic diversity and greater differentiation than
      populations from other continental regions. We observe gradients both of
      decreasing genetic diversity as a function of geographic distance from the
      Bering Strait and of decreasing genetic similarity to Siberians--signals
      of the southward dispersal of human populations from the northwestern tip
      of the Americas. We also observe evidence of: (1) a higher level of
      diversity and lower level of population structure in western South America
      compared to eastern South America, (2) a relative lack of differentiation
      between Mesoamerican and Andean populations, (3) a scenario in which
      coastal routes were easier for migrating peoples to traverse in comparison
      with inland routes, and (4) a partial agreement on a local scale between
      genetic similarity and the linguistic classification of populations. These
      findings offer new insights into the process of population dispersal and
      differentiation during the peopling of the Americas.

TI  - Austronesian genetic signature in East African Madagascar and Polynesia.
PG  - 106-20
AB  - The dispersal of the Austronesian language family from Southeast Asia
      represents the last major diaspora leading to the peopling of Oceania to
      the East and the Indian Ocean to the West. Several theories have been
      proposed to explain the current locations, and the linguistic and cultural
      diversity of Austronesian populations. However, the existing data do not
      support unequivocally any given migrational scenario. In the current
      study, the genetic profile of 15 autosomal STR loci is reported for the
      first time for two populations from opposite poles of the Austronesian
      range, Madagascar at the West and Tonga to the East. These collections are
      also compared to geographically targeted reference populations of
      Austronesian descent in order to investigate their current relationships
      and potential source population(s) within Southeast Asia. Our results
      indicate that while Madagascar derives 66.3% of its genetic makeup from
      Africa, a clear connection between the East African island and Southeast
      Asia can be discerned. The data suggest that although geographic location
      has influenced the phylogenetic relationships between Austronesian
      populations, a genetic connection that binds them beyond geographical
      divides is apparent.

TI  - Population genetics of dinucleotide (dC-dA)n.(dG-dT)n polymorphisms in
      world populations.
PG  - 461-74
AB  - We have characterized eight dinucleotide (dC-dA)n.(dG-dT)n repeat loci
      located on human chromosome 13q in eight human populations and in a sample
      of chimpanzees. Even though there is substantial variation in allele
      frequencies at each locus, at a given locus the most frequent alleles are
      shared by all human populations. The level of heterozygosity is reduced in
      isolated or small populations, such as the Pehuenche Indians of Chile, the
      Dogrib of Canada, and the New Guinea highlanders. On the other hand,
      larger average heterozygosities are observed in large and cosmopolitan
      populations, such as the Sokoto population from Nigeria and German
      Caucasians. Conformity with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is generally
      observed at these loci, unless (a) a population is isolated or small or
      (b) the repeat motif of the locus is not perfect (e.g., D13S197).
      Multilocus genotype probabilities at these microsatellite loci do not show
      departure from the independence rule, unless the loci are closely linked.
      The allele size distributions at these (CA)n loci do not follow a strict
      single-step stepwise-mutation model. However, this features does not
      compromise the ability to detect population affinities, when these loci
      are used simultaneously. The microsatellite loci examined here are present
      and, with the exception of the locus D13S197, are polymorphic in the
      chimpanzees, showing an overlapping distribution of allele sizes with
      those observed in human populations.

TI  - VNTR allele frequency distributions under the stepwise mutation model: a
      computer simulation approach.
PG  - 983-93
AB  - Variable numbers of tandem repeats (VNTRs) are a class of highly
      informative and widely dispersed genetic markers. Despite their wide
      application in biological science, little is known about their mutational
      mechanisms or population dynamics. The objective of this work was to
      investigate four summary measures of VNTR allele frequency distributions:
      number of alleles, number of modes, range in allele size and
      heterozygosity, using computer simulations of the one-step stepwise
      mutation model (SMM). We estimated these measures and their probability
      distributions for a wide range of mutation rates and compared the
      simulation results with predictions from analytical formulations of the
      one-step SMM. The average heterozygosity from the simulations agreed with
      the analytical expectation under the SMM. The average number of alleles,
      however, was larger in the simulations than the analytical expectation of
      the SMM. We then compared our simulation expectations with actual data
      reported in the literature. We used the sample size and observed
      heterozygosity to determine the expected value, 5th and 95th percentiles
      for the other three summary measures, allelic size range, number of modes
      and number of alleles. The loci analyzed were classified into three groups
      based on the size of the repeat unit: microsatellites (1-2 base pair (bp)
      repeat unit), short tandem repeats [(STR) 3-5 bp repeat unit], and
      minisatellites (15-70 bp repeat unit). In general, STR loci were most
      similar to the simulation results under the SMM for the three summary
      measures (number of alleles, number of modes and range in allele size),
      followed by the microsatellite loci and then by the minisatellite loci,
      which showed deviations in the direction of the infinite allele model
      (IAM). Based on these differences, we hypothesize that these three classes
      of loci are subject to different mutational forces.

TI  - Establishing the robustness of short-tandem-repeat statistics for forensic
      applications.
PG  - 398-407
AB  - Before the introduction of a four-locus multiplex short-tandem-repeat
      (STR) system into casework, an extensive series of tests were carried out
      to determine robust procedures for assessing the evidential value of a
      match between crime and suspect samples. Twelve databases were analyzed
      from the three main ethnic groups encountered in casework in the United
      Kingdom: Caucasians, Afro-Caribbeans, and Asians from the Indian
      subcontinent. Independence tests resulted in a number of significant
      results, and the impact that these might have on forensic casework was
      investigated. It is demonstrated that previously published methods provide
      a simple procedure for correcting allele frequencies--and that this leads
      to conservative casework estimates of evidential value.

TI  - Microsatellites and the genetics of highly selfing populations in the
      freshwater snail Bulinus truncatus.
PG  - 1237-47
AB  - Hermaphrodite tropical freshwater snails provide a good opportunity to
      study the effects of mating system and genetic drift on population genetic
      structure because they are self-fertile and they occupy transient patchily
      distributed habitats (ponds). Up to now the lack of detectable allozyme
      polymorphism prevented any intrapopulation studies. In this paper, we
      examine the consequences of selfing and bottlenecks on genetic
      polymorphism using microsatellite markers in 14 natural populations (under
      a hierarchical sampling design) of the hermaphrodite freshwater snail
      Bulinus truncatus. These population genetics data allowed us to discuss
      the currently available mutation models for microsatellite sequences.
      Microsatellite markers revealed an unexpectedly high levels of genetic
      variation with < or = 41 alleles for one locus and gene diversity of
      0.20-0.75 among populations. The values of any estimator of Fis indicate
      high selfing rates in all populations. Linkage disequilibria observed at
      all loci for some populations may also indicate high levels of inbreeding.
      The large extent of genetic differentiation measured by Fst, Rst or by a
      test for homogeneity between genic distributions is explained by both
      selfing and bottlenecks. Despite a limited gene flow, migration events
      could be detected when comparing different populations within ponds.

TI  - Dispersion of human Y chromosome haplotypes based on five microsatellites
      in global populations.
PG  - 1177-84
AB  - We have analyzed five microsatellite loci from the nonrecombining portion
      of the human Y chromosome in 15 diverse human populations to evaluate
      their usefulness in the reconstruction of human evolution and early male
      migrations. The results show that, in general, most populations have the
      same set of the most frequent alleles at these loci. Hypothetical
      ancestral haplotypes, reconstructed on the basis of these alleles and
      their close derivatives, are shared by multiple populations across racial
      and geographical boundaries. A network of the observed haplotypes is
      characterized by a lack of clustering of geographically proximal
      populations. In spite of this, few distinct clusters of closely related
      populations emerged in the network, which are associated with
      population-specific alleles. A tree based on allele frequencies also shows
      similar results. Lack of haplotypic structure associated with the presumed
      ancestral haplotypes consisting of individuals from almost all populations
      indicate a recent common ancestry and/or extensive male migration during
      human evolutionary history. The convergent nature of microsatellite
      mutation confounds population relationships. Optimum resolution of Y
      chromosome evolution will require the use of additional microsatellite
      loci and diallelic genetic markers with lower mutation rates.

TI  - An apportionment of human DNA diversity.
PG  - 4516-9
AB  - It is often taken for granted that the human species is divided in rather
      homogeneous groups or races, among which biological differences are large.
      Studies of allele frequencies do not support this view, but they have not
      been sufficient to rule it out either. We analyzed human molecular
      diversity at 109 DNA markers, namely 30 microsatellite loci and 79
      polymorphic restriction sites (restriction fragment length polymorphism
      loci) in 16 populations of the world. By partitioning genetic variances at
      three hierarchical levels of population subdivision, we found that
      differences between members of the same population account for 84.4% of
      the total, which is in excellent agreement with estimates based on allele
      frequencies of classic, protein polymorphisms. Genetic variation remains
      high even within small population groups. On the average, microsatellite
      and restriction fragment length polymorphism loci yield identical
      estimates. Differences among continents represent roughly 1/10 of human
      molecular diversity, which does not suggest that the racial subdivision of
      our species reflects any major discontinuity in our genome.

TI  - Microsatellite data support an early population expansion in Africa.
PG  - 586-91
AB  - We have developed a method for the analysis of microsatellite data that is
      useful in the elucidation of the demographic history of populations. This
      method, the PK distribution method of pairwise comparisons, is analogous
      to the mismatch distribution of sequence comparisons developed for the
      analysis of mitochondrial sequence data by Rodgers and Harpending and is
      defined as the distribution of the number of repeat unit differences
      between alleles when each allele in a sample is compared with every other
      allele in the sample. Using computer simulations of microsatellite loci,
      we show that the shape of the distribution of PK changes in a distinctive
      manner as a function either of time since population expansion or
      effective population size. Increases in both of these affect the PK
      distribution in a similar fashion leading to a change from a steep
      distribution with a Po peak to one with a nonzero peak. Analysis of three
      data sets from surveys of microsatellite loci in ethnographically defined
      populations reveals that most (9/12) of the African populations analyzed,
      but none of the 30 non-African populations showed PK distributions with
      nonzero peaks. These PK distributions indicate either an earlier expansion
      or a larger effective population size for African populations. This
      observation is consistent with the hypothesized African origin of modern
      human.
