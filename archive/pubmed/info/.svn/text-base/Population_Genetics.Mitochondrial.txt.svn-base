TI  - Pattern of nucleotide substitution and rate heterogeneity in the
      hypervariable regions I and II of human mtDNA.
PG  - 1103-10
AB  - This study provides a comprehensive survey of the complex pattern of
      nucleotide substitution in the control region of human mtDNA, which is of
      central importance to the studies of human evolution. A total of 1229
      different hypervariable region I (HVRI) and 385 different hypervariable
      region II (HVRII) sequences were analyzed using a complex substitution
      model. Moreover, we suggest a new method to assign relative rates to each
      site in the sequence. Estimates are based on maximum-likelihood methods
      applied to randomly selected subsets of sequences. Our results indicate
      that the rate of substitution in HVRI is approximately twice as high as in
      HVRII and that this difference is mainly due to a higher frequency of
      pyrimidine transitions in HVRI. However, rate heterogeneity is more
      pronounced in HVRII.

TI  - Human mtDNA hypervariable regions, HVR I and II, hint at deep common
      maternal founder and subsequent maternal gene flow in Indian population
      groups.
PG  - 497-506
AB  - We have analysed the hypervariable regions (HVR I and II) of human
      mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in individuals from Uttar Pradesh (UP), Bihar
      (BI) and Punjab (PUNJ), belonging to the Indo-European linguistic group,
      and from South India (SI), that have their linguistic roots in Dravidian
      language. Our analysis revealed the presence of known and novel mutations
      in both hypervariable regions in the studied population groups. Median
      joining network analyses based on mtDNA showed extensive overlap in mtDNA
      lineages despite the extensive cultural and linguistic diversity. MDS plot
      analysis based on Fst distances suggested increased maternal genetic
      proximity for the studied population groups compared with other world
      populations. Mismatch distribution curves, respective neighbour joining
      trees and other statistical analyses showed that there were significant
      expansions. The study revealed an ancient common ancestry for the studied
      population groups, most probably through common founder female lineage(s),
      and also indicated that human migrations occurred (maybe across and within
      the Indian subcontinent) even after the initial phase of female migration
      to India.

TI  - Harvesting the fruit of the human mtDNA tree.
PG  - 339-45
AB  - Human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) studies have entered a new phase since the
      blossoming of complete genome analyses. Sequencing complete mtDNAs is more
      expensive and more labour intensive than restriction analysis or simply
      sequencing the control region of the molecule. But the efforts are paying
      off, as the phylogenetic resolution of the mtDNA tree has been greatly
      improved, and, in turn, phylogeographic interpretations can be given
      correspondingly greater precision in terms of the timing and direction of
      human dispersals. Therefore, despite mtDNA being only a fraction of our
      total genome, the deciphering of its evolution is profoundly changing our
      perception about how modern humans spread across our planet. Here we
      illustrate the phylogeographic approach with two case studies: the initial
      dispersal out of Africa, and the colonization of Europe.

TI  - Branching pattern in the evolutionary tree for human mitochondrial DNA.
PG  - 1597-601
AB  - Eighty-eight types of mitochondrial (mt) DNA were found by sequencing the
      most variable part of the control region from 117 Caucasians. In the tree
      relating those types, most of the branching events occur about two-thirds
      of the way from the root of the tree to the tips of the branches.
      Moreover, the distribution of sequence differences between all possible
      pairs of individuals is approximately Poisson. Other non-African
      populations show a similar pattern. Assuming a neutral model, these
      findings imply that the probability of survival of new lineages has
      undergone dramatic changes, probably due to population expansion.
      Conversely, African populations show multimodal distributions fitting with
      a model of constant population size.

TI  - Mitochondrial and nuclear genes present conflicting portraits of human
      origins.
PG  - 166-72
AB  - Human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences reveal an abundance of
      polymorphic sites in which the frequencies of the segregating bases are
      very different. A typical polymorphism involves one base at low frequency
      and the other base at high frequency. In contrast, nuclear gene data sets
      tend to show an excess of polymorphisms in which both segregating bases
      are at intermediate frequencies. A new statistical test of this difference
      finds significant differences between mtDNA and nuclear gene data sets
      reported in the literature. However, differences in the polymorphism
      patterns could be caused by different sample origins for the different
      data sets. To examine the mtDNA-nuclear difference more closely, DNA
      sequences were generated from a portion of the X-linked pyruvate
      dehydrogenase E1 alpha subunit (PDHA1) locus and from a portion of
      mitochondrial control region I (CRI) from each of eight individuals, four
      from sub-Saharan Africa. The two genes revealed a significant difference
      in the site frequency distribution of polymorphic sites. PDHA1 revealed an
      excess of intermediate-frequency polymorphisms, while CRI showed an excess
      of sites with the low-high frequency pattern. The discrepancy suggests
      that mitochondrial variation has been shaped by natural selection, and may
      not be ideal for some questions on human origins.

TI  - Phylogeography of mitochondrial DNA in western Europe.
PG  - 241-60
AB  - For most of the past century, prehistorians have had to rely on the fossil
      and archaeological records in order to reconstruct the past. In the last
      few decades, this evidence has been substantially supplemented from
      classical human genetics. More recently, phylogenetic analyses of DNA
      sequences that incorporate geographical information have provided a
      high-resolution tool for the investigation of prehistoric demographic
      events, such as founder effects and population expansions. These events
      can be dated using a molecular clock when the mutation rate and founder
      haplotypes are known. We have previously applied such methods to sequence
      data from the mitochondrial DNA control region, to suggest that most
      extant mitochondrial sequences in western Europe have a local ancestry in
      the Early Upper Palaeolithic, with a smaller proportion arriving from the
      Near East in the Neolithic. Here, we describe a cladistic notation for
      mitochondrial variation and expand upon our earlier analysis to present a
      more detailed portrait of the European mitochondrial record.

TI  - The emerging tree of West Eurasian mtDNAs: a synthesis of control-region
      sequences and RFLPs.
PG  - 232-49
AB  - Variation in the human mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) is now routinely
      described and used to infer the histories of peoples, by means of one of
      two procedures, namely, the assaying of RFLPs throughout the genome and
      the sequencing of parts of the control region (CR). Using 95 samples from
      the Near East and northwest Caucasus, we present an analysis based on both
      systems, demonstrate their concordance, and, using additional available
      information, present the most refined phylogeny to date of west Eurasian
      mtDNA. We describe and apply a nomenclature for mtDNA clusters.
      Hypervariable nucleotides are identified, and the relative mutation rates
      of the two systems are evaluated. We point out where ambiguities remain.
      The identification of signature mutations for each cluster leads us to
      apply a hierarchical scheme for determining the cluster composition of a
      sample of Berber speakers, previously analyzed only for CR variation. We
      show that the main indigenous North African cluster is a sister group to
      the most ancient cluster of European mtDNAs, from which it diverged
      approximately 50,000 years ago.
