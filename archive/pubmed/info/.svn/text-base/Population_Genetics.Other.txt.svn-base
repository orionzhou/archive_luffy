TI  - A novel polymorphic Alu insertion embedded in a LINE 1 retrotransposon in
      the human X chromosome (DXS225): identification and worldwide population
      study.
PG  - 63-71
AB  - We describe a novel polymorphic Alu insertion (DXS225) on the human X
      chromosome (Xq21.3) embedded into an L1 retrotransposon. The DXS225
      polymorphism was genotyped in 684 males from the CEPH Human Genome
      Diversity Panel. This insertion was found in all regions of the globe,
      suggesting that it took place before modern humans spread from Africa ca.
      100,000 years ago. However, only one Amerindian population (Karitiana)
      showed this insertion allele, which may have been introduced by European
      admixture. Thus, it appears likely that the Alu insertion was absent from
      pre-Columbian America. Analysis of molecular variance worldwide
      demonstrated that 92.2% of the genetic variance was concentrated within
      populations. DXS225 is flanked by two microsatellites (DXS8114 and
      DXS1002), which are 86 kb apart and are in very strong linkage
      disequilibrium. The combination of a unique event polymorphism on the X
      chromosome in linkage disequilibrium with two rapidly evolving
      microsatellites should provide a useful tool for studies of human
      evolution.

TI  - African origin of human-specific polymorphic Alu insertions.
PG  - 12288-92
AB  - Alu elements are a family of interspersed repeats that have mobilized
      throughout primate genomes by retroposition from a few "master" genes.
      Among the 500,000 Alu elements in the human genome are members of the
      human-specific subfamily that are not fixed in the human species; that is,
      not all chromosomes carry an Alu element at a particular locus. Four such
      polymorphic human-specific Alu insertions were analyzed by a rapid,
      PCR-based assay that uses primers that flank the insertion point to
      determine genotypes based on the presence or absence of the Alu element.
      These four polymorphic Alu insertions were shown to be absent from the
      genomes of a number of nonhuman primates, consistent with their arising as
      human genetic polymorphisms sometime after the human/African ape
      divergence. Analysis of 664 unrelated individuals from 16 population
      groups from around the world revealed substantial levels of variation
      within population groups and significant genetic differentiation among
      groups. No significant associations were found among the four loci,
      consistent with their location on different chromosomes. A
      maximum-likelihood tree of population relationships showed four major
      groupings consisting of Africa, Europe, Asia/Americas, and Australia/New
      Guinea, which is concordant with similar trees based on other loci. A
      particularly useful feature of the polymorphic Alu insertions is that the
      ancestral state is known to be the absence of the Alu element, and the
      presence of the Alu element at a particular chromosomal site reflects a
      single, unique event in human evolution. A hypothetical ancestral group
      can then be included in the tree analysis, with the frequency of each
      insertion set to zero. The ancestral group connected to the
      maximum-likelihood tree within the African branch, which suggests an
      African origin of these polymorphic Alu insertions. These data are
      concordant with other diverse data sets, which lends further support to
      the recent African origin hypothesis for modern humans. Polymorphic Alu
      insertions represent a source of genetic variation for studying human
      population structure and evolution.

TI  - Alu insertion polymorphisms and human evolution: evidence for a larger
      population size in Africa.
PG  - 1061-71
AB  - Alu insertion polymorphisms (polymorphisms consisting of the
      presence/absence of an Alu element at a particular chromosomal location)
      offer several advantages over other nuclear DNA polymorphisms for human
      evolution studies. First, they are typed by rapid, simple, PCR-based
      assays; second, they are stable polymorphisms-newly inserted Alu elements
      rarely undergo deletion; third, the presence of an Alu element represents
      identity by descent-the probability that different Alu elements would
      independently insert into the exact same chromosomal location is
      negligible; and fourth, the ancestral state is known with certainty to be
      the absence of an Alu element. We report here a study of 8 loci in 1500
      individuals from 34 worldwide populations. African populations exhibit the
      most between-population differentiation, and the population tree is rooted
      in Africa; moreover, the estimated effective time of separation of African
      versus non-African populations is 137,000 +/- 15,000 years ago, in
      accordance with other genetic data. However, a principal coordinates
      analysis indicates that populations from Sahul (Australia and New Guinea)
      are nearly as close to the hypothetical ancestor as are African
      populations, suggesting that there was an early expansion of tropical
      populations of our species. An analysis of heterozygosity versus genetic
      distance suggests that African populations have had a larger effective
      population size than non-African populations. Overall, these results
      support the African origin of modern humans in that an earlier expansion
      of the ancestors of African populations is indicated.
