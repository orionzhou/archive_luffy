AB  - Genetic maps are used routinely in family-based linkage studies to
      identify the rough location of genes that influence human traits and
      diseases. Unlike physical maps, genetic maps are based on the amount of
      recombination occurring between adjacent loci rather than the actual
      number of bases separating them. Genetic maps are constructed by
      statistically characterizing the number of crossovers observed in parental
      meioses leading to the transmission of alleles to their offspring.
      Considerations such as the number of meioses observed, the heterozygosity
      and physical distance between the loci studied, and the statistical
      methods used can impact the construction and reliability of a genetic map.
      As is well known, poorly constructed genetic maps can have adverse effects
      on linkage mapping studies. With the availability of sequence-based maps,
      as well as genetic maps generated by different researchers (such as those
      generated by the Marshfield and deCODE groups), one can investigate the
      compatibility and properties of different maps. We have integrated
      information from the most current human genome sequence data (UCSC genome
      assembly Human July 2003) as well as 8399 microsatellite markers used in
      the Marshfield and deCODE maps to reconcile the these maps. Our efforts
      resulted in updated sex-specific genetic maps.

TI  - A brief review of short tandem repeat mutation.
PG  - 7-14
AB  - Short tandem repeats (STRs) are short tandemly repeated DNA sequences that
      involve a repetitive unit of 1-6 bp. Because of their polymorphisms and
      high mutation rates, STRs are widely used in biological research.
      Strand-slippage replication is the predominant mutation mechanism of STRs,
      and the stepwise mutation model is regarded as the main mutation model.
      STR mutation rates can be influenced by many factors. Moreover, some
      trinucleotide repeats are associated with human neurodegenerative
      diseases. In order to deepen our knowledge of these diseases and broaden
      STR application, it is essential to understand the STR mutation process in
      detail. In this review, we focus on the current known information about
      STR mutation.
