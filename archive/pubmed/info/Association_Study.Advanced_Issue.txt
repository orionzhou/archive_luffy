TI  - Whole genome association study of rheumatoid arthritis using 27 039
      microsatellites.
PG  - 2305-21
AB  - A major goal of current human genome-wide studies is to identify the
      genetic basis of complex disorders. However, the availability of an
      unbiased, reliable, cost efficient and comprehensive methodology to
      analyze the entire genome for complex disease association is still largely
      lacking or problematic. Therefore, we have developed a practical and
      efficient strategy for whole genome association studies of complex
      diseases by charting the human genome at 100 kb intervals using a
      collection of 27,039 microsatellites and the DNA pooling method in three
      successive genomic screens of independent case-control populations. The
      final step in our methodology consists of fine mapping of the candidate
      susceptible DNA regions by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
      analysis. This approach was validated upon application to rheumatoid
      arthritis, a destructive joint disease affecting up to 1% of the
      population. A total of 47 candidate regions were identified. The top seven
      loci, withstanding the most stringent statistical tests, were dissected
      down to individual genes and/or SNPs on four chromosomes, including the
      previously known 6p21.3-encoded Major Histocompatibility Complex gene,
      HLA-DRB1. Hence, microsatellite-based genome-wide association analysis
      complemented by end stage SNP typing provides a new tool for genetic
      dissection of multifactorial pathologies including common diseases.

TI  - SNP-SNP interactions in breast cancer susceptibility.
PG  - 114
AB  - BACKGROUND: Breast cancer predisposition genes identified to date (e.g.,
      BRCA1 and BRCA2) are responsible for less than 5% of all breast cancer
      cases. Many studies have shown that the cancer risks associated with
      individual commonly occurring single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are
      incremental. However, polygenic models suggest that multiple commonly
      occurring low to modestly penetrant SNPs of cancer related genes might
      have a greater effect on a disease when considered in combination.
      METHODS: In an attempt to identify the breast cancer risk conferred by SNP
      interactions, we have studied 19 SNPs from genes involved in major cancer
      related pathways. All SNPs were genotyped by TaqMan 5'nuclease assay. The
      association between the case-control status and each individual SNP,
      measured by the odds ratio and its corresponding 95% confidence interval,
      was estimated using unconditional logistic regression models. At the
      second stage, two-way interactions were investigated using multivariate
      logistic models. The robustness of the interactions, which were observed
      among SNPs with stronger functional evidence, was assessed using a
      bootstrap approach, and correction for multiple testing based on the false
      discovery rate (FDR) principle. RESULTS: None of these SNPs contributed to
      breast cancer risk individually. However, we have demonstrated evidence
      for gene-gene (SNP-SNP) interaction among these SNPs, which were
      associated with increased breast cancer risk. Our study suggests cross
      talk between the SNPs of the DNA repair and immune system (XPD-[Lys751Gln]
      and IL10-[G(-1082)A]), cell cycle and estrogen metabolism
      (CCND1-[Pro241Pro] and COMT-[Met108/158Val]), cell cycle and DNA repair
      (BARD1-[Pro24Ser] and XPD-[Lys751Gln]), and within carcinogen metabolism
      (GSTP1-[Ile105Val] and COMT-[Met108/158Val]) pathways. CONCLUSION: The
      importance of these pathways and their communication in breast cancer
      predisposition has been emphasized previously, but their biological
      interactions through SNPs have not been described. The strategy used here
      has the potential to identify complex biological links among breast cancer
      genes and processes. This will provide novel biological information, which
      will ultimately improve breast cancer risk management.

TI  - Evaluation of potential gene-gene interactions for attention deficit
      hyperactivity disorder in the Han Chinese population.
PG  - 200-6
AB  - Several lines of evidence suggest that attention-deficit/hyperactivity
      disorder (ADHD) is a polygenic disorder produced by the interaction of
      several genes with minor effects. To explore potential gene-gene
      interactions among candidate genes for ADHD, we studied the dopamine D2
      receptor (DRD2), dopamine D4 receptor (DRD4), dopamine transporter (DAT1),
      and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) genes in the Han Chinese
      population. A sample of 340 children with ADHD was diagnosed according to
      the DSM-IV criteria. We also recruited 226 unrelated controls. Identified
      polymorphisms included a 48-base-pair-repeat in Exon 3 of DRD4, a
      40-base-pair-repeat in the 3' untranslated region of DAT1, a
      restriction-fragment-length polymorphism at codon 158 of COMT, and a -241A
      > G transition in the promoter of DRD2. Associations of polymorphisms with
      ADHD and its subtypes were examined by comparing allele frequencies
      between probands and controls. Binary logistic regression analysis was
      used to examine the potential gene-gene interactions. Binary logistic
      regression analysis with the sample of refined phenotypes showed that male
      gender and long-repeat genotypes of DRD4 and DAT1 were independent risk
      factors for ADHD. We found no evidence for gene-gene interactions among
      the candidate genes studied. The present study suggests that dopamine
      candidate genes are associated with increased vulnerability to ADHD in the
      Han Chinese population.
