TI  - T102C polymorphism in the 5HT2A gene and schizophrenia: relation to
      phenotype and drug response variability.
PG  - 141-6
AB  - Although genes play a major role in the etiology of schizophrenia, no
      major genes involved in this disease have been identified. However,
      several genes with small effect have been reported, though inconsistently,
      to increase the risk for schizophrenia. Recently, the 5HT2A 2 allele
      (T102C polymorphism) was reported to be over-represented in patients with
      schizophrenia. Other reports have found an excess of allele 2(C) only in
      schizophrenic patients who are resistant to clozapine, not in those who
      respond to clozapine. In this study, the 5HT2A receptor allele 2
      frequencies were compared between 2 groups of patients with schizophrenia
      (39 responders and 63 nonresponders) based on long-term outcome and
      response to typical neuroleptics. A control group of 90 healthy volunteers
      screened for mental disorders was also included. Genotype 2/2 tended to be
      more frequent in patients with schizophrenia with poor long-term outcome
      and poor response to typical neuroleptics (Bonferroni corrected p = 0.09).
      This difference was significant in men (Bonferroni corrected p = 0.054)
      but not in women. In addition, the age at first contact with psychiatric
      care was significantly younger in the patients with schizophrenia with
      genotype 2/2 than in patients with genotype 1/1. These result suggest that
      the 5HT2A-receptor gene may play a role in a subset of schizophrenia
      characterized by poor long-term outcome and poor response to neuroleptics.

TI  - Schizophrenia and the serotonin-2A receptor promoter polymorphism.
PG  - 221-4
AB  - Serotonin-2A (5-HT2A) receptors have received much investigative attention
      in schizophrenia because (1) several studies have shown a decrease in the
      number of 5-HT2A receptors in the prefrontal cortex of postmortem brains
      of schizophrenic patients; (2) atypical antipsychotic drugs are
      antagonists for 5-HT2A receptors; and (3) a positive association between a
      T to C polymorphism at position 102 of the 5-HT2A receptor gene and
      schizophrenia has been reported. A G to A polymorphism at position -1438
      of the 5-HT2A receptor gene was studied in 119 schizophrenic patients and
      106 healthy control subjects, all of whom were Japanese. The genotype and
      allele frequencies did not differ between the patients and control
      subjects. Furthermore, the genotype frequency did not differ according to
      diagnostic subtype, family history, age at onset of illness, or daily
      dosage of antipsychotic medication. Our results suggest that the
      polymorphism does not contribute to the etiology or clinical
      characteristics of schizophrenia. However, the gene is greater than 20 kbp
      in length, and thus it is possible that other areas that affect expression
      of the gene may vary. We found that the -1438G/A variant was in linkage
      disequilibrium with the T102C polymorphism.

TI  - Serotonin-2A receptor gene is not associated with symptomatology of
      schizophrenia.
PG  - 84-7
AB  - The serotonin receptor type 2A (5-HT2A) is a primary candidate for
      involvement in major psychoses. Polymorphisms within the 5-HT2A gene have
      recently been reported to be associated with a variety of
      psychopathological conditions. In the present study, we investigated the
      potential influence of the T102C polymorphism on the psychopathology of
      schizophrenia. One hundred eighty-eight inpatients affected by
      schizophrenia (DSM-III-R) were assessed by the Operational Criteria
      checklist for psychotic illness (OPCRIT) and were typed for their 5-HT2A
      variants by PCR techniques. Mania, depression, delusion and
      disorganization were the four symptomatologic factors previously derived
      from our psychotic population that were used to define phenotype in our
      sample. Genetic variants of the polymorphism under study were not
      associated with these symptomatologic factors, and consideration of
      possible stratification effects such as sex and age of onset did not
      reveal any association either. Our results do not, therefore, support the
      hypothesis that the serotonin receptor 2A gene is a liability factor for
      the symptomatology of schizophrenia as defined by the OPCRIT checklist.

TI  - Negative association between T102C polymorphism at the 5-HT2A receptor
      gene and bipolar affective disorders in Singaporean Chinese.
PG  - 211-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: Serotonergic system abnormalities have been implicated in the
      pathogenesis of bipolar affective disorders. The 5-hydroxytryptamine type
      2A (5HTR2A) receptor gene located on chromosome 13 (13q14-21) can be
      considered as a candidate gene for bipolar affective disorder (BPAD).
      METHODS: Seventy-two patients with BPAD and 74 normal population controls
      were genotyped with restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) in the
      5HTR2A receptor gene. RESULTS: We report a negative association between
      5HTR2A receptor gene and BPAD. The association was examined using a
      case-control design. Allele and genotype frequencies as well as
      homozygote-heterozygote distribution at the 5HTR2A receptor gene
      polymorphism were compared between the two groups. There were no
      significant differences in the allelic or genotype frequencies and the
      homozygote-heterozygote distributions. Limitations: Patients were
      recruited from one hospital in Singapore. The case-control study design
      needs replication. CONCLUSION: Our finding indicates that the 5HTR2A
      receptor gene polymorphism is not a major factor in the genetic
      susceptibility to BPAD in Singaporean Chinese.

TI  - Decreased serotonin 2A receptor densities in neuroleptic-naive patients
      with schizophrenia: A PET study using [(18)F]setoperone.
PG  - 1016-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors compared serotonin receptor binding in patients
      with schizophrenia and healthy comparison subjects. METHOD: They used
      positron emission tomography with [(18)F]setoperone to examine six
      patients with schizophrenia who had never been given neuroleptics and
      seven age-matched subjects who did not have schizophrenia. RESULTS: A
      nondirected voxel-based analysis of the subjects' entire search volume
      found that serotonin 2A binding potential in the frontal cortex index was
      significantly smaller (by 16.3%) in patients with schizophrenia than in
      healthy subjects. CONCLUSIONS: The authors conclude that the decrease in
      serotonin receptor densities previously reported in postmortem studies of
      subjects with schizophrenia are present at the onset of the illness,
      before exposure to neuroleptics.

TI  - Association between the serotonin 2A receptor gene and tardive dyskinesia
      in chronic schizophrenia.
PG  - 225-9
AB  - Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a long-term adverse effect of antipsychotic
      drugs that are dopamine D2 receptor blockers.(1) Serotonin receptor
      antagonism has been proposed as a common mechanism contributing to the low
      extrapyramidal effects profile of atypical antipsychotic drugs.(2) We
      examined the association of three polymorphisms in the 5-HT2A receptor
      gene (HTR2A) with TD susceptibility--T102C(3) and his452tyr(4) in the
      coding region and A-1438G(5) in the promoter--in matched schizophrenia
      patients with (n = 59, SCZ-TD-Y) and without TD (n = 62, SCZ-TD-N) and
      normal control subjects (n = 96). The T102C and the A-1438G polymorphisms
      are in complete linkage disequilibrium but not his452tyr. There was a
      significant excess of 102C and -1438G alleles (62.7%) in the SCZ-TD-Y
      patients compared to SCZ-TD-N patients (41.1%) and controls (45.9%; chi(2)
      = 12.8, df = 2, P = 0.002; SCZ-TD-Y vs SCZ-TD-N, chi(2) = 11.4, df = 1, P
      = 0.0008, OR 2.41, 95% CI 1.43-3.99) and of 102CC and -1438GG genotypes
      (SCZ-TD-Y 42.4%, SCZ-TD-N, 16.1%, controls 20.8%, chi(2) = 13.3, df = 4, P
      = 0.01). The 102CC and the -1438GG genotypes were associated with
      significantly higher AIMS trunk dyskinesia scores (F = 3.9; df = 2, 116; P
      = 0.02) and more incapacitation (F = 5.0; df = 2, 115; P = 0.006). The
      his452tyr polymorphism showed no association with TD. These findings
      suggest that the 5-HT2A receptor gene is significantly associated with
      susceptibility to TD in patients with chronic schizophrenia. Previously
      reported association of the T102C and A-1438G polymorphisms with
      schizophrenia(6) may reflect association of a sub-group of patients with a
      susceptibility to abnormal involuntary movements related to antipsychotic
      drug exposure.

TI  - Lack of association between serotonin-2A receptor gene (HTR2A)
      polymorphisms and tardive dyskinesia in schizophrenia.
PG  - 230-4
AB  - Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a disabling neurological side effect associated
      with long-term treatment with typical antipsychotics. Family studies and
      animal models lend evidence for hereditary predisposition to TD. The newer
      atypical antipsychotics pose a minimal risk for TD which is in part
      attributed to their ability to block the serotonin-2A (5-HT(2A)) receptor.
      5-HT(2A) receptors were also identified in the basal ganglia; a brain
      region that plays a critical role in antipsychotic-induced movement
      disorders. We tested the significance of variation in the 5-HT(2A)
      receptor gene (HTR2A) in relation to the TD phenotype. Three polymorphisms
      in HTR2A, one silent (C102T), one that alters the amino acid sequence
      (his452tyr) and one in the promoter region (A-1437G) were investigated in
      136 patients refractory or intolerant to treatment with typical
      antipsychotics and with a DSM-IIIR diagnosis of schizophrenia. We did not
      find any significant difference in allele, genotype or haplotype
      frequencies of polymorphisms in HTR2A among patients with or without TD (P
      > 0.05). Further analysis using the ANCOVA statistic with a continuous
      measure of the TD phenotype (Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS)
      score) found that the AIMS scores were not significantly influenced by
      HTR2A polymorphisms, despite controlling for potential confounders such as
      age, gender and ethnicity (P > 0.05). Theoretically, central serotonergic
      function can be subject to genetic control at various other mechanistic
      levels including the rate of serotonin synthesis (tryptophane hydroxylase
      gene), release, reuptake (serotonin transporter gene) and degradation
      (monoamine oxidase gene). Analyses of these other serotonergic genes are
      indicated. In summary, polymorphisms in HTR2A do not appear to influence
      the risk for TD. Further studies evaluating in tandem multiple candidate
      genes relevant for the serotonergic system are warranted to dissect the
      genetic basis of the complex TD phenotype.

TI  - Association study of schizophrenia with polymorphisms at six candidate
      genes.
PG  - 65-71
AB  - Clinical studies have shown that there is a genetic contribution to the
      pathogenesis of schizophrenia. The molecular mechanisms of effective
      antipsychotic drugs and recent advances in neural development suggest that
      several dopamine receptor, serotonin receptor and neurotrophic factor
      genes might be involved in the disorder. In this study, we assessed the
      associations between schizophrenia and polymorphisms in the D2 and D3
      dopamine receptor (DRD2, DRD3), the serotonin 2A receptor (5HTR2A), the
      brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), the ciliary neurotrophic factor
      (CNTF) and the neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) genes. Our results suggest that the
      polymorphisms at the DRD3, 5HTR2A, CNTF and BDNF gene loci are unlikely to
      make our sample more genetically susceptible to schizophrenia. However, we
      found significant differences in microsatellite allele frequencies between
      schizophrenic and control groups for DRD2 in the whole sample and for DRD2
      and NT-3 only in women. Therefore, clinical differences in the
      presentation of schizophrenia between gender might be related to genetic
      factors.

TI  - 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors and their atypical regulation properties.
PG  - 2429-49
AB  - The 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(2C) receptors belong to the G-protein-coupled
      receptor (GPCR) superfamily. GPCRs transduce extracellular signals to the
      interior of cells through their interaction with G-proteins. The 5-HT(2A)
      and 5-HT(2C) receptors mediate effects of a large variety of compounds
      affecting depression, schizophrenia, anxiety, hallucinations, dysthymia,
      sleep patterns, feeding behaviour and neuro-endocrine functions. Binding
      of such compounds to either 5-HT(2) receptor subtype induces processes
      that regulate receptor sensitivity. In contrast to most other receptors,
      chronic blockade of 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(2C) receptors leads not to an up-
      but to a (paradoxical) down-regulation. This review deals with published
      data involving such non-classical regulation of 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(2C)
      receptors obtained from in vivo and in vitro studies. The underlying
      regulatory processes of the agonist-induced regulation of 5-HT(2A) and
      5-HT(2C) receptors, commonly thought to be desensitisation and
      resensitisation, are discussed. The atypical down-regulation of both
      5-HT(2) receptor subtypes by antidepressants, antipsychotics and 5-HT(2)
      antagonists is reviewed. The possible mechanisms of this paradoxical
      down-regulation are discussed, and a new hypothesis on possible
      heterologous regulation of 5-HT(2A) receptors is proposed.

TI  - Meta-analysis of association between the T102C polymorphism of the 5HT2a
      receptor gene and schizophrenia.
PG  - 53-62
AB  - A meta-analysis of whole-genome linkage scans confirmed linkage between
      schizophrenia and markers on the long arm of chromosome 13. The gene
      HTR2A, which codes for the 5HT2a receptor, is located in this area. The
      T102C single nucleotide polymorphism of HTR2A has been the subject of much
      research. The production of the C-allele form of HTR2A is significantly
      less than that of the T-allele form in normal controls and schizophrenic
      patients. Although the association of schizophrenia with the C allele of
      HTR2A was confirmed by a meta-analysis 5 years ago, there was a continuous
      debate because negative findings were also considerable, which may have
      been due to ethnic differences in association. We performed another
      meta-analysis, since the number of available studies of this association
      has recently doubled. In the meta-analysis of 31 case-control association
      studies, we found a significant association between the C allele of the
      T102C polymorphism and schizophrenia, which was more pronounced in
      European samples than in the entire sample. We found significant
      heterogeneity in the allele-wise analysis (C vs. T) and homozygous
      genotype-wise analysis (CC vs. TT), both of which were at least partially
      explained by differences between samples from Asian and European
      countries. In East Asian countries, there was not a significant
      association with the C allele or CC homozygosity, indicating strong
      genetic differences and noncombinability of data between European and East
      Asian populations. Interestingly, the frequency of the T allele was much
      higher in East Asian patients and controls (59.5% and 57.5%, respectively)
      than in European patients and controls (40% and 43.5%, respectively). In
      five family-based association studies, we did not find significant
      evidence for association of the C allele with schizophrenia; yet, the
      pooled OR was 1.3 (95% CI=0.9-1.8, z=1.47, p=0.14), which is consistent
      with the results of the case-control studies. The effects of other genes,
      environmental effects on DNA methylation, or different methods of
      classification may be the causes for such heterogeneity, but more study in
      this area is needed.

TI  - Serotonin 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, and 5-HT2A receptor mRNA expression in subjects
      with major depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia.
PG  - 225-33
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alterations of serotonin neurotransmission are implicated in
      both mood disorders and schizophrenia. Specific serotonin-receptor-based
      abnormalities in these psychiatric illnesses have been intensively
      studied; however, it has been difficult to draw any conclusions because of
      a lack of consensus. These inconsistencies have most likely arisen from
      the unavailability of selective ligands. METHODS: Our study used in situ
      hybridization to quantify 5-HT(1A), 5-HT(1B), and 5-HT(2A) mRNA levels in
      the hippocampus (HC) and 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(2A) mRNA levels in the
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of subjects with a history of major
      depression disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BPD), schizophrenia, and a
      normal comparison group (15 subjects per group). RESULTS: In the DLPFC,
      there is a significant decrease in 5-HT(1A) mRNA of subjects with MDD and
      in 5-HT(2A) mRNA of subjects with BPD. Subjects with MDD have a
      significant decrease in 5-HT(1A) mRNA in the HC; subjects with BPD and
      schizophrenia had increased 5-HT(1B) mRNA levels and a significant
      decrease in 5-HT(2A) mRNA levels in the hippocampal formation.
      CONCLUSIONS: Alterations in 5-HT(1A,) 5-HT(1B), and 5-HT(2A) mRNA levels
      in the brains of subjects with both mood disorders and schizophrenia add
      further support for hypothesis of dysregulation of the serotonergic system
      in these psychiatric disorders.

TI  - 102T/C SNP in the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2A (HTR2A) gene and
      schizophrenia in two southern Han Chinese populations: lack of
      association.
PG  - 16-8
AB  - Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) is a neurotransmitter that occupies
      a uniquely important place in neurobiology because of its role in many
      physiologic processes such as sleep, appetite, thermoregulation, pain
      perception, hormone secretion, and sexual behavior. Serotonin dysfunction
      has been implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Previous studies
      have shown an association between the T102C polymorphism of the
      5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2A (HTR2A) gene and schizophrenia. However,
      many negative findings have also been reported. We analyzed the T102C
      polymorphism of HTR2A of schizophrenic patients in two southern Chinese
      populations (n = 291) and matched controls (n = 307). No significant
      positive association was observed between either of the polymorphisms and
      all schizophrenics, nor was the polymorphisms and any population of
      schizophrenia. These data did not provide evidence for a contribution of
      the 102T/C SNP of HTR2A gene to susceptibility to the southern Han Chinese
      schizophrenia.

TI  - Association between schizophrenia and DRD3 or HTR2 receptor gene variants.
PG  - 535-41
AB  - Schizophrenia is a severe and common psychiatric disorder afflicting 1% of
      the world population. A role of many neurotransmitter receptors in
      schizophrenia was suggested by an association with several polymorphisms
      located in their coding regions. In this study we examined the
      contribution of the T-102C and A-206G transitions in the 5-HTR2a and DRD3
      receptor genes respectively to genetic susceptibility and phenotypic
      expression of schizophrenia disorder within the Greek population. We
      determined by PCR and RFLP analysis the genotype for the above
      polymorphisms in 114 schizophrenic hospitalized individuals and 192
      control samples. In contrast to previous reports from large European
      multicentre studies, which indicate significant correlation between
      schizophrenia and C-102 allele of the T-102C polymorphism, in this study
      we observed a statistically significant overall association between the
      disorder and allele T-102 (P<0.0001, odds ratio (OR)=2.11, 95%
      CI=1.48-3.02). We also found a highly significant excess of the
      T-102/C-102 and C-102/C-102 genotypes in the normal group (P<0.001).
      Comparison of the patients with the controls for the DRD3 polymorphism
      (A-206G transition) showed marginally nonsignificant differences in the
      genotypic (P=0.054) and no significance in the allelic (P=0.163)
      frequencies. However, the A-206/A-206 genotype seems to positively
      contribute to the disorder appearance, when compared to A-206/G-206 as
      genotype base line risk (P=0.016, OR=1.88, 95% CI=1.09-3.26). In
      conclusion, from genetic association analysis of this schizophrenic
      population, a significant association is clearly determined between the
      HTR2 genetic polymorphism and the presence of schizophrenic disorder,
      manifested as increased risk of schizophrenia for carriers of the T-102
      allele.

TI  - Methylomics in psychiatry: Modulation of gene-environment interactions may
      be through DNA methylation.
PG  - 51-9
AB  - Fine-tuning of neuronal connections during development is regulated
      through environmental interactions. Some fine-tuning occurs through
      changes in gene expression and/or epigenetic gene-specific DNA methylation
      states. DNA methylation occurs by transfer of a methyl group from
      S-adenosyl methionine to cytosine residues in the dinucleotide sequence
      CpG. Although CpG sequences spread throughout the genome are usually
      heavily methylated, those occurring in CpG islands in the promoter regions
      of genes are less methylated. In most cases, the extent of DNA methylation
      correlates with the extent of gene inactivation. Other known epigenetic
      mechanisms include histone deacetylation and chromatin remodeling, RNA
      inhibition, RNA modification, and DNA rearrangement. Exposure memory
      expressed as epigenetic DNA modifications allows genomic plasticity and
      short-term adaptation of each generation to their environment.
      Environmental factors that affect DNA methylation include diet, proteins,
      drugs, and hormones. Induced methylation changes may produce altered gene
      response upon subsequent hormonal stimulation. The gene-specific DNA
      methylation state may be preserved upon transmission through mitosis and
      meiosis. An increasing amount of data implicates a role for DNA
      methylation in multi-factorial psychiatric disorders. For example,
      L-methionine treatment can exacerbate psychosis; while valproate, a drug
      producing hypomethylated DNA, reduces such symptoms. Hypermethylation of
      the promoter region of the RELN gene correlates with reduced gene
      expression. This gene's protein Reelin, which is necessary for neuronal
      migration and synaptogenesis, is reduced in schizophrenia and bipolar
      disorder, suggesting hypermethylation of the promoter region in these
      disorders. Some evidence implicates methylation of the promoter regions of
      the DRD2 and HTR2A genes in schizophrenia and mood disorders as well. DNA
      methylation usually increases with age, although hypomethylation of the
      promoter region of the amyloid A4 precursor gene during aging may play a
      role in Alzheimer's disease. More studies are needed to define the role of
      methylomics and other epigenetic phenomena in the nervous system.

TI  - A PET study of dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2 receptor occupancy in
      patients with schizophrenia treated with therapeutic doses of ziprasidone.
PG  - 818-25
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Ziprasidone is an atypical antipsychotic drug that shows a
      higher affinity for serotonin 5-HT(2) receptors compared with dopamine
      D(2) receptors in vitro. The affinity of ziprasidone for these receptors
      in vivo in patients was examined in a positron emission tomography (PET)
      study. METHOD: The authors conducted a PET study to evaluate D(2)
      occupancy (using [(11)C]raclopride) and 5-HT(2) occupancy (using
      [(18)F]setoperone) in brain regions of interest in 16 patients with
      schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder randomly assigned to receive 40,
      80, 120, or 160 mg/day of ziprasidone, which reflected the recommended
      dose range. PET scanning was done after 3 weeks of administration and at
      trough plasma levels, i.e., 12-16 hours after the last dose. RESULTS: The
      mean 5-HT(2) receptor occupancy was significantly higher than the mean
      D(2) receptor occupancy (mean=76%, SD=15%, and mean=56%, SD=18%,
      respectively). The estimated plasma ziprasidone concentration associated
      with 50% maximal 5-HT(2) receptor occupancy was almost four times lower
      than that for D(2) receptor occupancy. CONCLUSIONS: These data affirm that
      ziprasidone is similar to other novel antipsychotics in having greater
      5-HT(2) than D(2) receptor occupancy at therapeutic doses and suggest that
      the optimal effective dose of ziprasidone is closer to 120 mg/day than to
      the lower doses suggested by previous PET studies. The relatively high
      D(2) receptor occupancy, even at trough plasma levels, suggests that
      ziprasidone is more similar to risperidone and olanzapine in receptor
      occupancy profile than to clozapine and quetiapine. Since ziprasidone
      plasma levels show significant (more than twofold) variation within a
      single dose cycle, studies that are aimed at peak plasma levels (6 hours
      after the last dose) and that examine extrastriatal regions are required
      to fully characterize the in vivo occupancy profile of ziprasidone.

TI  - Drug development for anxiety disorders: new roles for atypical
      antipsychotics.
PG  - 38-45
AB  - Anxiety disorders are prevalent and frequently comorbid with depression.
      Rates of response and remission for anxiety disorders are low despite
      marked improvements in treatment in the past several decades.
      Antidepressants and anxiolytics remain the most frequently prescribed
      agents for anxiety disorders, but the numbers of prescriptions for novel
      forms of therapy, such as anticonvulsants and atypical antipsychotics are
      increasing. For the atypical antipsychotics, agonist activity at the
      5-HT1A receptor has been hypothesized to translate into anxiolytic
      effects. A small, but growing, literature suggests that atypical
      antipsychotics are useful as augmentation therapy for treatment of
      refractory anxiety disorders. The next generation antipsychotic,
      aripiprazole, has a unique mechanism of action (ie, combined D2 and 5-HT1A
      partial agonist and 5-HT2A antagonist) and improves depressive and
      depressive/anxiety symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. Further
      studies examining the effect of aripiprazole and other atypical
      antipsychotic drugs on depressive and anxiety symptoms in patients with
      refractory anxiety disorders are warranted. Psychopharmacology Bulletin.

TI  - No association of the T102C polymorphism of the serotonin 2A receptor gene
      (HTR2A) with suicidality in schizophrenia.
PG  - 301-5
AB  - Additional evidence for a role of serotonin (5-HT) in the pathogenesis of
      suicidal behavior is provided by a recent report that the 5-HT2A (HTR2A)
      T102C polymorphism was associated with suicidality in patients with major
      depression. Three other studies have, however, failed to find an
      association between this polymorphism and suicidality in major depression.
      The goal of the present study was to test the association of allele C of
      T102C HTR2A polymorphism with suicidality in patients with schizophrenia
      or schizoaffective disorder. Seventy-one patients with DSM-III-R diagnosis
      of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were included in the study.
      Patients were genotyped for the T102C HTR2A polymorphism. Information
      about lifetime suicidality was obtained during the course of SADS
      interviews. In addition, current suicidality was assessed by the Hamilton
      Depression Scale in 46 patients. There were no significant differences in
      allele frequencies and genotype distributions between suicidal and
      non-suicidal patients using lifetime or current suicidality measures. The
      results of this study did not demonstrate a robust association of the
      allele C of the T102C HTR2A polymorphism with lifetime or current
      suicidality in patients with schizophrenia. However, the mean Hamilton
      Depression Scale item for current suicidality was significantly higher in
      patient with genotype T/C compared to those with genotype C/C (p = 0.01)
      and marginally higher than for the patients with genotype T/T (p=0.06).
      The relatively small sample size suggests a study with a larger sample and
      greater power would be of interest.

TI  - Meta-analysis in psychiatric genetics.
PG  - 143-51
AB  - The article reviews literature on methods for meta-analysis of genetic
      linkage and association studies, and summarizes and comments on specific
      meta-analysis findings for psychiatric disorders. The Genome Scan
      Meta-Analysis and Multiple Scan Probability methods assess the evidence
      for linkage across studies. Multiple Scan Probability analysis suggested
      linkage of two chromosomal regions (13q and 22q) to schizophrenia and
      bipolar disorder, whereas Genome Scan Meta-Analysis on a larger sample
      identified at least 10 schizophrenia linkage regions, but none for bipolar
      disorder. Meta-analyses of pooled ORs support association of schizophrenia
      to the Ser311Cys polymorphism in DRD2 and the T102C polymorphism in HTR2A,
      and of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder to the 48-bp repeat in
      DRD4. The 5-HTTLPR polymorphism in the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4)
      may contribute to the risk of bipolar disorder, suicidal behavior, and
      neuroticism, but association to the lifetime risk of major depression has
      not been shown. Meta-analyses support linkage of schizophrenia to regions
      where replicable associations to candidate genes have been identified
      through positional cloning methods. There are additional supported regions
      where susceptibility genes are likely to be identified. Linkage
      meta-analysis has had less clear success for bipolar disorder based on a
      smaller dataset. Meta-analysis can guide the prioritization of regions for
      study, but proof of association requires biological confirmation of
      hypotheses about gene actions. Elucidation of causal mechanisms will
      require more comprehensive study of sequence variation in candidate genes,
      better statistical and meta-analytic methods to take all variation into
      account, and biological strategies for testing etiologic hypotheses.

TI  - 5-HT2A and muscarinic receptors in schizophrenia: a postmortem study.
PG  - 164-8
AB  - Although evidence suggests that 5-HT(2A) and muscarinic M1/M4 receptors
      are implicated in the pathology of schizophrenia, the results are not
      conclusive. In the present study we tested the hypothesis that binding of
      5-HT(2A) and M1/M4 receptors is altered in the postmortem brain of
      schizophrenia subjects. Quantitative autoradiography was employed to
      measure [(3)H]ketanserin binding to 5-HT(2A) receptors and
      [(3)H]pirenzepine binding to both M1 and M4 receptors in Brodmann's area 9
      (BA9), caudate/putamen, and the hippocampal formation from six
      schizophrenic and six control subjects. A significant reduction in the
      density of 5HT(2A) receptors in BA 9 of schizophrenic subjects was
      observed (p=0.036). No significant difference was observed in the density
      of 5HT(2A) receptors in the hippocampus or caudate/putamen between the two
      groups. No significant changes in the density of M1/M4 receptors was
      observed in these three regions between the two groups. These findings
      support a possible involvement of the serotonergic system in the pathology
      of schizophrenia.

      pharmacotherapy, patient response is often varied and these novel
      compounds are not without their own side effect profile, most notably
      weight gain. Inter-individual variations in response to drug treatment
      are, in part, due to polymorphisms of the genes encoding drug targets. The
      importance of the serotonin system in psychiatric symptomatology and
      several side effects of antipsychotic drugs is well established. Thus
      genetic polymorphisms of two central 5-HT receptors (5-HT2A and 2C), at
      which many of the newer antipsychotic drugs act, are prime candidates for
      pharmacogenetic analysis of the effects of these drugs in the treatment of
      schizophrenia. To date, much work has focussed on the 5-HT2A receptor
      subtype. However, pharmacological evidence and recent molecular genetic
      studies would suggest a role for the 5-HT2C receptor in the consequences
      of antipsychotic treatment, particularly in relation to the development of
      both drug-induced dyskinesias and weight gain. This review briefly
      examines the pharmacology and physiology of the 5HT2C receptor in the
      context of its genetics, with discussion of known polymorphisms of this
      receptor gene and its promoter region. Associations between these
      polymorphisms and the development of schizophrenia, the symptom responses
      to antipsychotic treatment and side effects of such treatment, notably
      tardive dyskinesia and weight gain, are assessed and related to the
      presumed functionality of these polymorphisms. Such studies clearly
      demonstrate the potential of pharmacogenetics in optimising treatment for
      the individual patient.

TI  - Distinct functional profiles of aripiprazole and olanzapine at RNA edited
      human 5-HT2C receptor isoforms.
PG  - 521-9
AB  - In this study we have functionally characterized aripiprazole (OPC-14597;
      7-(4-[4-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)-1-piperazinyl]butyloxy-3,4-dihydro-2-(1H)-qui
      nolinone), the prototype of a new generation antipsychotic drug termed
      dopamine-serotonin-system stabilizer, in cells expressing
      5-hydroxytryptamine2 (5-HT2) receptor subtypes in comparison with
      olanzapine. In Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably expressing 5-HT2
      receptors, aripiprazole displayed a dual agonist/antagonist profile for
      5-HT2C receptor (VNI isoform) mediated calcium signaling (EC50 1070 nM,
      IC50 281 nM). It exhibited no appreciable 5-HT2A or 5-HT2B agonism,
      whereas it antagonized 5-HT-stimulated calcium increase at either 5-HT2A
      or 5-HT2B receptor expressed in CHO cells (IC50s of 369 and 0.46 nM,
      respectively). In comparison, olanzapine was devoid of agonism but was an
      antagonist at all three subtypes, with a potency rank order of 5-HT2A
      (IC50, 2.5 nM)>5-HT2B (47 nM)>5-HT2C (69 nM). In human embryonic kidney
      (HEK) cells transiently expressing 5-HT2C receptor isoforms, aripiprazole
      exhibited full agonism at the unedited INI, but partial agonism at the
      partially edited VNI and fully edited VSV isoforms (EC50s of 571, 1086 and
      2099 nM, respectively). A partial antagonism was also observed for
      aripiprazole at the two edited isoforms (IC50s of 1138 and 1000 nM,
      respectively). In contrast, while lacking agonist activity at the VNI and
      VSV, olanzapine showed inverse agonism at the INI isoform (IC50 594 nM),
      reaching a maximal attenuation of 20%. In addition, olanzapine was a full
      antagonist at all three isoforms, with a rank order of potency of VNI
      (IC50, 79 nM)>VSV (101 nM)>INI (3856 nM). The modest 5-HT2A antagonism and
      5-HT2C partial agonism, along with reported D2 and 5-HT1A partial agonism,
      may allow aripiprazole to stabilize the disturbed dopamine-serotonin
      interplay in schizophrenia with a moderate yet adequate pharmacological
      intervention. 5-HT2C agonism may also underlie the minimal weight gain
      seen with aripiprazole.

TI  - Association study of serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2A) gene with
      schizophrenia and suicidal behavior using systematic meta-analysis.
PG  - 1006-15
AB  - Serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2A) gene was implicated to be associated with
      both schizophrenia and suicidal behavior due to its role of key
      neurotransmitter in many physiologic processes. Association studies were
      reported in different populations, however, a great number of subsequent
      studies have produced contrary results, possibly reflecting inadequate
      statistical power. With the cumulative data in recent years in both
      European and Asian populations, particularly in Asian populations, it was
      necessary to carry out a comprehensive analysis of previous findings. The
      meta-analysis, therefore, combined all English and Chinese studies using
      multiple research methods published up to July 2005 to give a new picture
      of the role of the 5-HT2A gene. Compared with significant results reported
      previously, the current large samples (73 studies in all) failed to find
      significant association of the T102C polymorphism with either
      schizophrenia or suicidal behavior. Evidence of significant association
      was only detected between A-1438G and suicidal behavior. The current study
      did not support the association of the 5-HT2A gene with either
      schizophrenia or suicidal behavior.

TI  - Monoallelic and unequal allelic expression of the HTR2A gene in human
      brain and peripheral lymphocytes.
PG  - 1331-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: The 102T/C polymorphism of the serotonin 2A receptor (HTR2A)
      gene is reported to be associated with schizophrenia and other diseases
      and phenotypes. Altered HTR2A expression has been found in relation to
      several neuropsychiatric conditions, including depression and
      schizophrenia. Studies of expression of HTR2A messenger RNA (mRNA) and
      protein in postmortem brains suggest that the 102C allele might be less
      transcriptionally active than the T allele. However, equal expression of
      both alleles has also been reported. METHODS: We performed primer
      extension assays to measure relative expression of allele-specific HTR2A
      transcripts in mRNAs isolated from the prefrontal cortex of 31 individuals
      with schizophrenia and from peripheral lymphocytes (PBLs) of 31 healthy
      individuals heterozygous for 102T/C. We also examined the allele
      transmission pattern of HTR2A in PBLs of nine families. RESULTS: Analyses
      of DNA and mRNA revealed that 102C is expressed but at lower levels than
      102T in brains. In contrast to the biallelic expression observed in
      brains, monoallelic expression of HTR2A was common in PBLs. However, a
      family study revealed that imprinting was not responsible for the
      monoallelic expression in PBLs. CONCLUSIONS: The present study revealed a
      tissue-specific modification of HTR2A expression, which makes allelic and
      epiallelic analyses necessary for genetic epidemiologic and
      pharmacogenomic studies of HTR2A.

TI  - Association of a serotonin receptor 2A gene polymorphism with cognitive
      functions in patients with schizophrenia.
PG  - 704-7
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the association between the T102C
      polymorphism on the 5HT2A gene and cognitive function as well as clinical
      manifestations in patients with schizophrenia. Eighty-two outpatients with
      schizophrenia participated in this study. The Brief Psychiatric Rating
      Scale (BPRS) was used to assess the severity of each patient's symptoms.
      In order to evaluate their short-term attention capacity, a Digit Span
      Test was used. The Continuous Performance Test (CPT) was used to test the
      sustained attention span of each of the subjects. Cognitive flexibility
      was measured with the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). The polymorphism
      of the 5-HT2A gene at codon 102 (T/C) was genotyped by sequence specific
      polymerase chain reaction. The T allele at codon 102 correlated with a
      lower hit rate and more commission errors in the CPT and patients with the
      heterogeneous genotype (TC) had more commission errors than those who were
      of homogeneous type (CC or TT). Patients with the TC genotype also had
      significantly fewer correct responses in the WCST compared to those who
      were type CC or TT. No relationship was found to exist between the C
      allele and cognitive variables. There was also no relationship established
      between the codon 102 polymorphism and clinical parameters. These findings
      suggest that the TC genotype might be related to certain cognitive
      impairments in patients with schizophrenia.

TI  - Supportive evidence for the association between the T102C 5-HTR2A gene
      polymorphism and schizophrenia: a large-scale case-control and
      family-based study.
PG  - 167-70
AB  - Serotonin type 2A receptors (5-HTR2A) have long been implicated in
      schizophrenia pathology. A decreased number of these receptors were found
      in postmortem brain studies of schizophrenic patients as well as in
      experiments using neuroimaging techniques. Molecular genetic studies
      revealed that the T102C polymorphism of the 5-HTR2A gene is associated
      with schizophrenia, with the CC genotype frequency being higher in
      patients compared to healthy controls. However the association was not
      confirmed in all studies. We carried out a replication study, which aimed
      at searching for association between this polymorphism and schizophrenia
      in a large samples of patients (n=919), their psychiatrically well
      first-degree relatives (n=330) and screened controls (n=500). The C allele
      and the CT+CC genotype frequencies were significantly higher in patients
      than in controls (chi2=5.1; df=1; p=0.02; OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.0-1.4) and
      chi2=5.4; df=1; p=0.02; OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.1-1.8 respectively). In a
      family-based study, the transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) and the
      family-based association test (FBAT) did not show a preferential
      transmission of any allele. In conclusion, our replication study provides
      further evidence for association between the 5-HTR2A receptor T102C
      polymorphism and schizophrenia.

TI  - Association study of serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2A) and serotonin
      transporter (5-HTT) gene polymorphisms with schizophrenia.
PG  - 741-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate (i) the association between four serotonergic
      polymorphisms (A-1438G and T102C of the 5-HT2A receptor gene, and 5-HTT
      VNTR and 5-HTTLPR of the 5-HT transporter gene) and schizophrenia and (ii)
      the potential interaction of those polymorphisms in the development of
      schizophrenia. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: 227 outpatients with schizophrenia
      (DSM-IV criteria) and 420 unrelated healthy controls from Asturias
      (Northern Spain) were genotyped using standard methods. RESULTS: Both
      groups showed Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for the analyzed genetic
      variability. A-1438G and T102C polymorphisms are in complete linkage
      disequilibrium in our population. There was an apparent difference in the
      distribution of genotypes for the A-1438G (or T102C) polymorphisms
      (p=0.018, not significant after a Bonferroni correction). The 5-HT2A
      -1438A (or 102T) allele was significantly more frequent in patients than
      controls (0.53 and 0.45, respectively; corrected p=0.028, OR=1.39 (95%
      CI=1.11-1.75)). Genotype and allele distributions for 5-HTT polymorphisms
      were similar in both groups. However, assessment of the combined influence
      of 5-HT2A A-1438G and 5-HTTLPR polymorphisms demonstrated a significant
      effect (chi(2) (3)=11.51, p=0.009), whereby the combination of -1438A and
      5-HTTLPR S alleles was associated with schizophrenia. CONCLUSIONS: Our
      findings support a possible synergistic effect of genetic factors
      influencing serotonergic neurotransmission on susceptibility to
      schizophrenia.

TI  - Association analysis between the C516T polymorphism in the 5-HT2A receptor
      gene and schizophrenia.
PG  - 11-4
AB  - Data from epidemiological studies have demonstrated that genetics is an
      important risk factor for schizophrenia. Disturbances of serotonergic
      brain pathways have been implicated in the pathophysiology of
      schizophrenia. Some studies have suggested that the efficacy of atypical
      antipsychotics on schizophrenia treatment may be related to the serotonin
      2A receptor (5-HT2A), and that serotonergic drugs may induce psychotic
      symptoms. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the association
      between the C516T polymorphism and schizophrenia in a Brazilian population
      composed by 246 patients and 315 healthy matched controls in a
      case-control approach. No statistically differences were observed in
      allelic (chi2=1.77, 1d.f., p=0.18) or genotypic (chi2=1.69, 2d.f., p=0.42)
      distributions between cases and controls. The results suggest that the
      C516T polymorphism of the 5-HT2A receptor gene is not related to the
      susceptibility for schizophrenia in our Brazilian sample.

TI  - Low baseline serotonin-2A receptors predict clinical response to
      olanzapine in first-episode schizophrenia patients.
PG  - 103-9
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine whether platelet serotonin-2A
      (5-HT2A) binding sites and inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate (IP3)
      concentrations before treatment can identify olanzapine-responsive
      patients. The study included 21 never medicated, first-episode
      schizophrenia patients (antipsychotic-naive) and 21 patients with a
      DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia who had not received depot
      antipsychotic treatment in the previous 6 months or oral antipsychotic or
      antidepressant treatment in the previous 2 months (antipsychotic-free). In
      the antipsychotic-naive group, olanzapine responders had a significantly
      lower number of 5-HT2A receptors and lower IP3 concentrations at baseline
      than non-responders. The combination of baseline 5-HT2A and IP3 values
      significantly predicted an improvement in negative symptomatology after 6
      weeks of treatment with olanzapine. In the antipsychotic-free group,
      responders had significantly higher positive and lower negative
      symptomatology at baseline, together with a reduced number of 5-HT2A
      receptors. However, basal 5-HT2A receptors or IP3 concentrations did not
      significantly predict positive, negative or general clinical response. The
      reported results suggest that platelet 5-HT2A binding might be a trait
      marker that could help to identify those patients likely to show greater
      improvement in negative symptomatology after olanzapine treatment.

TI  - HTR2A gene variants and psychiatric disorders: a review of current
      literature and selection of SNPs for future studies.
PG  - 2053-69
AB  - Variants at the gene encoding for the 5-hydrosytryptamine (serotonin)
      receptor 2A (HTR2A) have been associated with many psychiatric disorders
      such as schizophrenia, mood disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity
      disorder, suicide, anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder,
      eating disorders, and Alzheimer's disease. The studied SNPs differ across
      studies, in the present review we focused on available evidence with the
      aim of identifying the overall phenotypic profile of HTR2A variant
      carriers. We then extensively analyzed all SNPs of the HTR2A gene with
      criteria of frequency, haplotype blocks, previous evidence, functionality
      in order to obtain a list of suitable SNPs for future studies that
      properly cover all possible genetic control of the HTR2A gene. Genetic
      association studies report conflicting and generally negative results.
      Most replicated data suggest C allele of the 102 T/C and Tyr452 variants
      as risk factor for psychosis and antipsychotic response, but the number of
      not replicating studies does not allow to draw any definite conclusion.
      Moreover their impact as risk factors is very small. In the other
      investigated psychiatric fields, evidence shows no involvement or at least
      a small and not replicated role for HTR2A gene variants. Conflicting and
      negative results could be due to a real marginal role of this receptor
      gene variants, or it could be caused by a lack of gene coverage of
      investigated SNPs. We suggest a wider investigation of the HTR2A gene to
      better understand its role in psychiatric disorders, preferably
      complemented with the use of proteomic or metabolomic approaches.

TI  - PET evidence that loxapine is an equipotent blocker of 5-HT2 and D2
      receptors: implications for the therapeutics of schizophrenia.
PG  - 1525-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Loxapine, a dibenzoxazepine antipsychotic, is closely related
      to clozapine and shares clozapine's high affinity for binding to serotonin
      5-HT2 and dopamine D4 receptors. The purpose of this study was to document
      loxapine's 5-HT2 and D2 receptor occupancy in vivo in patients with
      psychoses. METHOD: Ten patients who were taking loxapine (10-100 mg/day)
      had their D2 and 5-HT2 receptors assessed by means of positron emission
      tomography with [11C]raclopride and [18F]setoperone, respectively.
      RESULTS: The D2 receptor occupancy ranged from 43% to 90%; 5-HT2 occupancy
      varied from 27% to near saturation. Statistical comparison of the results
      showed that loxapine was equipotent in blocking 5-HT2 and D2 receptors.
      CONCLUSIONS: Loxapine differs from typical neuroleptics in demonstrating a
      high degree of 5-HT2 receptor occupancy. However, it is not "atypical"
      like clozapine and risperidone, since its 5-HT2 occupancy is not higher
      than its D2 occupancy. The results demonstrate that a high level of 5-HT2
      occupancy is not a sufficient condition for atypicality. If atypical
      antipsychotic action is predicated on a combination of 5-HT2 and D2
      effects, then it requires > 80% 5-HT2 occupancy in conjunction with < 80%
      D2 occupancy.

TI  - Selective effects on prefrontal cortex serotonin by dopamine D3 receptor
      agonism: interaction with low-dose haloperidol.
PG  - 1141-53
AB  - 1. Negative symptoms of schizophrenia are characterized by amotivation,
      anhedonia and anergia. These aspects of the symptom profile can be modeled
      by D3 agonism in animal behavioral models. 2. Serotonergic systems have
      been implicated in pathophysiologic substrates for this disorder; most
      notably, in deficit state schizophrenia, as newer 'atypical' neuroleptics
      which are especially efficacious for treating this syndrome antagonize
      central 5-HT2 receptors. 3. FC regions may also be important in chronic
      negative symptoms, as hypofrontality has been associated with these
      schizophrenic features. 4. The author examined effects of a
      behaviorally-active dose of the D3 agonist, 7OH, on 5-HT metabolism in FC,
      and the ability of a low-dose neuroleptic treatment to antagonize this
      biochemical effect. 5. Acute administration of 7OH induced a selective
      decrease of 5-HT turnover in the FC without affecting metabolism of this
      transmitter in more subcortical DA regions. 6. Hal, which has previously
      been demonstrated to antagonize electrophysiologic, biochemical and
      behavioral effects of 7OH, was without effect on agonist-induced decreases
      in 5-HT turnover. 7. The biochemical association between D3 agonism and
      reductions of FC 5-HT may be significant for pathophysiologic mechanisms
      of negative symptoms, and antagonism of this effect may differ for
      neuroleptics with varying efficacy in alleviating these symptoms.

TI  - Serotonin subtype 2 receptor genes and clinical response to clozapine in
      schizophrenia patients.
PG  - 123-32
AB  - Using a pharmacogenetic approach in 185 schizophrenics who have been
      prospectively assessed for clozapine response, we have examined the
      hypothesis that polymorphisms in the 5-HT2A (HTR2A), and 5-HT2C (HTR2C)
      genes are involved in its variable response. A-1438 A-->G polymorphism in
      the putative promoter and a silent T-->C 102 substitution in HTR2A were in
      almost complete linkage disequilibrium, and neither was associated with
      response (T-->C. 102 allele: chi 2 = 0.02; 1 df, p = .90; genotype: chi 2
      = 0.02, 2 df, p = .99). A his452tyr HTR2A polymorphism was found to be
      associated with clozapine response (his452tyr allele: chi 2 = 6.43, 1 df,
      p = .01 [p = .04, Bonferroni corrected]; genotype: chi 2 = 6.54, 2 df, p =
      .04 [p = .16, Bonferroni corrected]). No HTR2A haplotype was associated
      with response. Interethnic differences were observed in the frequencies of
      the cys23ser HTR2C polymorphism. This polymorphism was not significantly
      associated with response in either of the ethnic groups (Caucasian and
      African American genotype: chi 2 = 3.46, 2 df, p = .18; chi 2 = .31, 2 df,
      p = .86, respectively). Although replication is required, the overall
      results suggest that the his452tyr HTR2A polymorphism may be involved in
      clozapine response.

TI  - 5-HT2 and D2 receptor occupancy of olanzapine in schizophrenia: a PET
      investigation.
PG  - 921-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Olanzapine is a new atypical antipsychotic recently introduced
      for the treatment of schizophrenia. The purpose of this study was to
      investigate olanzapine's binding to the serotonin 5-HT2 and dopamine D2
      receptors in schizophrenic patients being treated with clinically relevant
      doses. METHOD: Twelve patients with schizophrenia were randomly assigned
      to 5, 10, 15, or 20 mg/day of olanzapine in a prospective fashion. Three
      other subjects taking 30-40 mg/day were also included. Once steady-state
      plasma levels were achieved, dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2 receptors
      were assessed by using [11C]raclopride and [18F]setoperone positron
      emission tomography imaging, respectively. Ratings of clinical status,
      extrapyramidal side effects, and prolactin levels were also obtained.
      RESULTS: Olanzapine induced near saturation of the 5-HT2 receptors, even
      at 5 mg/day. Its D2 occupancy increased with dose: patients taking 5-20
      mg/day showed 43%-80% D2 occupancy, while patients taking 30-40 mg/day
      showed 83%-88%. CONCLUSIONS: Olanzapine is a potent 5-HT2 blocker and
      shows a higher 5-HT2 than D2 occupancy at all doses. However, its D2
      occupancy is higher than that of clozapine and similar to that of
      risperidone. In the usual clinical dose range of 10-20 mg/day, its
      occupancy varies from 71% to 80%, and this restricted range may explain
      its freedom from extrapyramidal side effects and prolactin elevation.
      However, doses of 30 mg/day and higher are associated with more than 80%
      D2 occupancy and may have a higher likelihood of prolactin elevation and
      extrapyramidal side effects.

TI  - Lack of association between neuroleptic malignant syndrome and

PG  - 1275-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The molecular basis of neuroleptic malignant syndrome is
      unclear, but studies suggest that genetic factors are involved in its
      pathogenesis. Considering possible involvement of the serotonergic system
      in neuroleptic malignant syndrome, the authors examined the association
      between neuroleptic malignant syndrome and polymorphisms of the 5-HT1A and
      5-HT2A receptor genes. METHOD: The authors examined the frequencies of
      gene polymorphisms in the 5-HT1A (Arg219Leu) and 5-HT2A (Thr25Asn and
      His452Tyr) receptor genes in 29 patients previously diagnosed with
      neuroleptic malignant syndrome, 94 neuroleptic-treated patients with
      schizophrenia who had no history of neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and 94
      healthy comparison subjects. Polymerase chain reaction and restriction
      fragment length polymorphism analyses were used to screen gene mutations.
      RESULTS: No polymorphic allele was detected in the patients who had
      experienced the neuroleptic malignant syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: The authors
      cannot conclude that polymorphisms in the 5-HT1A and 5HT2A receptor genes
      are factors determining susceptibility to the neuroleptic malignant
      syndrome.

TI  - Serotonin 5-HT2 receptors in schizophrenia: a PET study using
      [18F]setoperone in neuroleptic-naive patients and normal subjects.
PG  - 72-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Several postmortem studies have reported a decreased density of
      serotonin 5-HT2 receptors in the prefrontal cortex in schizophrenia. The
      purpose of this study was to investigate this in patients with
      schizophrenia by means of [18F]setoperone and positron emission tomography
      (PET) imaging. METHOD: Thirteen neuroleptic-free patients with
      schizophrenia, 10 of whom were also neuroleptic-naive, were compared with
      a group of 26 normal subjects in the same age range. The density of 5-HT2
      receptors was assessed with the use of [18F]setoperone and PET in
      standardized cortical regions of interest. RESULTS: Increasing age was
      associated with similar declines in 5-HT2 receptors in all cortical
      regions in the patient group and in the normal comparison group. After
      control for the effect of age, there was no statistically significant
      difference between the patients and the comparison subjects in 5-HT2
      receptor density in any of the cortical regions. CONCLUSIONS: This study
      failed to find the decrease in 5-HT2 receptors reported in postmortem
      studies of schizophrenia. The study had the power to detect a decrease of
      25% or more in 5-HT2 receptors, which was anticipated on the basis of the
      previous postmortem studies. Thus, a primary serotonergic abnormality in
      schizophrenia, if one exists, is either small or unlikely to be at the
      level of the 5-HT2 receptors. This finding does not rule out a therapeutic
      role for 5-HT2 antagonists in schizophrenia, but it does suggest that the
      therapeutic contribution is likely to be an indirect one.

TI  - Clinical and theoretical implications of 5-HT2 and D2 receptor occupancy
      of clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine in schizophrenia.
PG  - 286-93
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Dopamine D2 receptor occupancy measurements provide a valid
      predictor of antipsychotic response, extrapyramidal side effects, and
      elevation of prolactin levels. The new antipsychotics clozapine,
      risperidone, and olanzapine obtain antipsychotic response with few
      extrapyramidal side effects and little prolactin elevation. The purpose of
      this study was to compare the D2 and serotonin 5-HT2 receptor occupancies
      of these drugs in patients receiving multiple-dose, steady-state regimens.
      METHOD: Forty-four patients with schizophrenia (16 taking risperidone,
      2-12 mg/day; 17 taking olanzapine, 5-60 mg/day; and 11 taking clozapine,
      75-900 mg/day) had their D2 and 5-HT2 occupancies determined with the use
      of [11C]raclopride and [18F]setoperone, respectively, and positron
      emission tomography imaging. RESULTS: Clozapine showed a much lower D2
      occupancy (16%-68%) than risperidone (63%-89%) and olanzapine (43%-89%).
      Risperidone and olanzapine gave equal D2 occupancies at doses of 5 and 20
      mg/day, respectively. All three drugs showed greater 5-HT2 than D2
      occupancy at all doses, although the difference was greatest for
      clozapine. CONCLUSIONS: Clozapine, at doses known to be effective in
      routine clinical settings, showed a D2 occupancy clearly lower than that
      of typical antipsychotics, while risperidone and olanzapine at their usual
      clinical doses gave the same level of D2 occupancy as low-dose typical
      antipsychotics. The results also suggest that some previous clinical
      comparisons of antipsychotics may have been confounded by different levels
      of D2 occupancy. Clinical comparisons of these drugs, matching for D2
      occupancy, may provide a better measure of their true "atypicality" and
      will help in understanding the contribution of non-D2 receptors to
      antipsychotic effects.
