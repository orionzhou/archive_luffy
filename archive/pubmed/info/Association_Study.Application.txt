TI  - Genetic analysis of multiple sclerosis.
PG  - 111-6
AB  - Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex disease with a significant genetic
      contribution. Similar to other complex diseases, the genetic risk for MS
      results from a combination of many genetic variants which individually
      confer only modest effects. Here we review the results of the
      complementary genetic approaches of linkage and association in MS,
      highlighting the challenges of identifying loci of modest effect. We
      describe meta-analytical approaches that provide additional statistical
      power necessary for detecting such loci and further apply this approach to
      evaluate the association of a CTLA-4 variant with MS. Lastly, we review
      recent important advances in our understanding of the patterns of genetic
      variation in the human genome and speculate about how these advances will
      aid in future studies of the genetic causes of MS.

TI  - Global haplotype diversity in the human insulin gene region.
PG  - 2101-11
AB  - The insulin minisatellite (INS VNTR) has been intensively analyzed due to
      its associations with diseases including diabetes. We have previously used
      patterns of variant repeat distribution in the minisatellite to
      demonstrate that genetic diversity is unusually great in Africans compared
      to non-Africans. Here we analyzed variation at 56 single nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs) flanking the minisatellite in individuals from six
      populations, and we show that over 40% of the total genetic variance near
      the minisatellite is due to differences between Africans and non-Africans,
      far higher than seen in most genomic regions and consistent with
      differential selection acting on the insulin gene region, most likely in
      the non-African ancestral population. Linkage disequilibrium was lower in
      African populations, with evidence of clustering of historical
      recombination events. Analysis of haplotypes from the relatively
      nonrecombining region around the minisatellite revealed a star-shaped
      phylogeny with lineages radiating from an ancestral African-specific
      haplotype. These haplotypes confirmed that minisatellite lineages defined
      by variant repeat distributions are monophyletic in origin. These analyses
      provide a framework for a cladistic approach to future disease association
      studies of the insulin region within both African and non-African
      populations, and they identify SNPs which can be rapidly analyzed as
      surrogate markers for minisatellite lineage.

TI  - Candidate gene association study in type 2 diabetes indicates a role for
      genes involved in beta-cell function as well as insulin action.
PG  - E20
AB  - Type 2 diabetes is an increasingly common, serious metabolic disorder with
      a substantial inherited component. It is characterised by defects in both
      insulin secretion and action. Progress in identification of specific
      genetic variants predisposing to the disease has been limited. To
      complement ongoing positional cloning efforts, we have undertaken a
      large-scale candidate gene association study. We examined 152 SNPs in 71
      candidate genes for association with diabetes status and related
      phenotypes in 2,134 Caucasians in a case-control study and an independent
      quantitative trait (QT) cohort in the United Kingdom. Polymorphisms in
      five of 15 genes (33%) encoding molecules known to primarily influence
      pancreatic beta-cell function-ABCC8 (sulphonylurea receptor), KCNJ11
      (KIR6.2), SLC2A2 (GLUT2), HNF4A (HNF4alpha), and INS
      (insulin)-significantly altered disease risk, and in three genes, the risk
      allele, haplotype, or both had a biologically consistent effect on a
      relevant physiological trait in the QT study. We examined 35 genes
      predicted to have their major influence on insulin action, and three
      (9%)-INSR, PIK3R1, and SOS1-showed significant associations with diabetes.
      These results confirm the genetic complexity of Type 2 diabetes and
      provide evidence that common variants in genes influencing pancreatic
      beta-cell function may make a significant contribution to the inherited
      component of this disease. This study additionally demonstrates that the
      systematic examination of panels of biological candidate genes in large,
      well-characterised populations can be an effective complement to
      positional cloning approaches. The absence of large single-gene effects
      and the detection of multiple small effects accentuate the need for the
      study of larger populations in order to reliably identify the size of
      effect we now expect for complex diseases.

      and association of common IL8 receptor variants with peripheral blood
      eosinophil counts.
PG  - 781-7
AB  - Airway inflammation is a major factor in the pathogenesis of asthma.
      Interleukin 8 (IL8) is a potent proinflammatory cytokine that interacts
      with its receptors, IL8RA and IL8RB. We investigated the genetic
      polymorphisms in IL8, IL8RA, and IL8RB for any association with risk of
      asthma and peripheral blood eosinophil counts in a Korean population. By
      carrying out direct sequencing in 24 individuals, we identified 20
      sequence variants within exons and their flanking regions, including the
      1.5 kb promoter regions of IL8, IL8RA, and IL8RB. Among them, seven common
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected for genotyping in our
      asthma cohort (n = 1,439). Two common haplotypes in IL8 and three in IL8RA
      and IL8RB (defined as one block) were identified. Although none of the
      polymorphisms showed a significant association with risk of asthma,
      IL8RA-B ht2 showed a significant association with the peripheral blood
      eosinophil counts (%) among asthma patients, e.g., lower eosinophil levels
      among individuals with the homozygous IL8RA-B ht2 (3.55 +/- 3.39%) than
      among other asthmatic patients (5.52 +/- 5.55%; P (corr) = 0.018). Our
      findings suggest that polymorphisms and haplotypes in IL8RA and IL8RB
      might be among the genetic factors underlying production of peripheral
      blood eosinophil.

TI  - Association study of the vesicular monoamine transporter 1 (VMAT1) gene
      with schizophrenia in a Japanese population.
PG  - 39
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vesicular monoamine transporters (VMATs) mediate accumulation
      of monoamines such as serotonin, dopamine, adrenaline, and noradrenaline
      from the cytoplasm into storage organelles. The VMAT1 (alternatively
      solute carrier family 18: SLC18A1) regulates such biogenic amines in
      neuroendocrine systems. The VMAT1 gene maps to chromosome 8p21.3, a locus
      with strong evidence of linkage with schizophrenia. A recent study
      reported that a non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the
      gene (Pro4Thr) was associated with schizophrenia. METHODS: We attempted to
      replicate this finding in a Japanese sample of 354 schizophrenics and 365
      controls. In addition, we examined 3 other non-synonymous SNPs (Thr98Ser,
      Thr136Ile, and Val392Leu). Genotyping was performed by the TaqMan allelic
      discrimination assay. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in
      genotype or allele distribution of the three SNPs of Pro4Thr, Thr136Ile,
      or Val392Leu between patients and controls. There was, however, a
      significant difference in genotype and allele distributions for the
      Thr98Ser polymorphism between the two groups (P = 0.01 for genotype and
      allele). When sexes were examined separately, significant differences were
      observed in females (P = 0.006 for genotype, P = 0.003 for allele), but
      not in males. The Thr98 allele was more common in female patients than in
      female controls (odds ratio 1.69, 95% CI 1.19-2.40, P = 0.003).
      Haplotype-based analyses also provided evidence for a significant
      association in females. CONCLUSION: We failed to replicate the previously
      reported association of Pro4Thr of the VMAT1 gene with schizophrenia.
      However, we obtained evidence for a possible role of the Thr98Ser in
      giving susceptibility to schizophrenia in women.

TI  - Association study between the monoamine oxidase A gene and attention
      deficit hyperactivity disorder in Taiwanese samples.
PG  - 10
AB  - BACKGROUND: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common
      and highly heritable disorder of childhood characterized by inattention,
      hyperactivity and impulsivity. Molecular genetic and pharmacological
      studies suggest the involvement of the dopaminergic, serotonergic and
      noradrenergic neurotransmitter systems in the pathogenesis of ADHD.
      Monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) encodes an enzyme that degrades biogenic
      amines, including neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine, dopamine and
      serotonin. In this study we examined a 30 bp promoter variable number
      tandem repeat (VNTR) and a functional G/T single nucleotide polymorphism
      (SNP) at position 941 in exon 8 (941G/T) of MAO-A for association with
      ADHD in a Taiwanese sample of 212 ADHD probands. METHODS: Within-family
      transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) was used to analyse association of
      MAO-A polymorphisms with ADHD in a Taiwanese population. RESULTS: A
      nominally significant association was found between the G-allele of 941G/T
      in MAO-A and ADHD (TDT: P = 0.034. OR = 1.57). Haplotype analysis
      identified increased transmission of a haplotype consisting of the
      3-repeat allele of the promoter VNTR and the G-allele of the 941G/T SNP (P
      = 0.045) to ADHD cases which the strong association with the G-allele
      drove. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest the importance of the 941G/T
      MAO-A polymorphism in the development of ADHD in the Taiwanese population.
      These results replicate previously published findings in a Caucasian
      sample.

      family trios from the Quebec Founder Population (QFP). Haplotype-based
      association analyses identified multiple regions associated with the
      disease that met the criteria for genome-wide significance, with many
      containing a gene whose function appears relevant to CD. A proportion of
      these were replicated in two independent German Caucasian samples,
      including the established CD loci NOD2 and IBD5. The recently described
      IL23R locus was also identified and replicated. For this region, multiple
      individuals with all major haplotypes in the QFP were sequenced and
      extensive fine mapping performed to identify risk and protective alleles.
      Several additional loci, including a region on 3p21 containing several
      plausible candidate genes, a region near JAKMIP1 on 4p16.1, and two larger
      regions on chromosome 17 were replicated. Together with previously
      published loci, the spectrum of CD genes identified to date involves
      biochemical networks that affect epithelial defense mechanisms, innate and
      adaptive immune response, and the repair or remodeling of tissue.

TI  - Evidence by allelic association-dependent methods for a type 1 diabetes
      polygene (IDDM6) on chromosome 18q21.
PG  - 1003-10
AB  - Type 1 diabetes is a common polygenic disease. Fine mapping of polygenes
      by affected sibpair linkage analysis is not practical and allelic
      association or linkage disequilibrium mapping will have to be employed to
      attempt to detect founder chromosomes. Given prior evidence of linkage of
      the Jk-D18S64 region of chromosome 18q12-q21 to type 1 diabetes, we
      evaluated the 12 informative microsatellite markers in the region for
      linkage with disease by the transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) in a UK
      data set of type 1 diabetic families (n = 195). Increased transmission of
      allele 4 of marker D18S487 to affected children was detected (P = 0.02).
      Support for this was extended in a total of 1067 families from four
      different countries by isolating, and evaluating by the TDT, two novel
      microsatellites within 70 kb of D18S487. Evidence for linkage and
      association was P = 5 x 10(-5) and 3 x 10(-4), respectively. There was no
      evidence for increased transmission of associated alleles to nonaffected
      siblings. Analysis of an additional 390 families by the TDT did not extend
      the evidence further, and reduced support in the total 1457 families to P
      = 0.001 for linkage and P = 0.003 for association. However, evidence for
      linkage by affected sibpair allele sharing was strong (P = 3.2 x 10(-5))
      in the second data set. Heterogeneity in TDT results between data sets
      was, in part, accounted for by the presence of more than one common
      disease-associated haplotype (allelic heterogeneity) which confounds the
      analysis of individual alleles by the TDT. Guidelines for strategies for
      the mapping of polygenes are suggested with the emphasis on collections of
      large numbers of families from multiple populations that should be as
      genetically homogeneous as possible.

TI  - A genome-wide scan for human obesity genes reveals a major susceptibility
      locus on chromosome 10.
PG  - 304-8
AB  - Obesity, a common multifactorial disorder, is a major risk factor for type
      2 diabetes, hypertension and coronary heart disease (CHD). According to
      the definition of the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 6-10%
      of the population in Westernized countries are considered obese.
      Epidemiological studies have shown that 30-70% of the variation in body
      weight may be attributable to genetic factors. To date, two genome-wide
      scans using different obesity-related quantitative traits have provided
      candidate regions for obesity. We have undertaken a genome-wide scan in
      affected sibpairs to identify chromosomal regions linked to obesity in a
      collection of French families. Model-free multipoint linkage analyses
      revealed evidence for linkage to a region on chromosome 10p (MLS=4.85).
      Two further loci on chromosomes 5cen-q and 2p showed suggestive evidence
      for linkage of serum leptin levels in a genome-wide context. The peak on
      chromosome 2 coincided with the region containing the gene (POMC) encoding
      pro-opiomelanocortin, a locus previously linked to leptin levels and fat
      mass in a Mexican-American population and shown to be mutated in obese
      humans. Our results suggest that there is a major gene on chromosome 10p
      implicated in the development of human obesity, and the existence of two
      further loci influencing leptin levels.
