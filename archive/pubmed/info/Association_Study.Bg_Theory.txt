TI  - The effects of human population structure on large genetic association
      studies.
PG  - 512-7
AB  - Large-scale association studies hold substantial promise for unraveling
      the genetic basis of common human diseases. A well-known problem with such
      studies is the presence of undetected population structure, which can lead
      to both false positive results and failures to detect genuine
      associations. Here we examine approximately 15,000 genome-wide
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms typed in three population groups to assess
      the consequences of population structure on the coming generation of
      association studies. The consequences of population structure on
      association outcomes increase markedly with sample size. For the size of
      study needed to detect typical genetic effects in common diseases, even
      the modest levels of population structure within population groups cannot
      safely be ignored. We also examine one method for correcting for
      population structure (Genomic Control). Although it often performs well,
      it may not correct for structure if too few loci are used and may
      overcorrect in other settings, leading to substantial loss of power. The
      results of our analysis can guide the design of large-scale association
      studies.

TI  - Logistic regression protects against population structure in genetic
      association studies.
PG  - 290-6
AB  - We conduct an extensive simulation study to compare the merits of several
      methods for using null (unlinked) markers to protect against false
      positives due to cryptic substructure in population-based genetic
      association studies. The more sophisticated "structured association"
      methods perform well but are computationally demanding and rely on
      estimating the correct number of subpopulations. The simple and fast
      "genomic control" approach can lose power in certain scenarios. We find
      that procedures based on logistic regression that are flexible,
      computationally fast, and easy to implement also provide good protection
      against the effects of cryptic substructure, even though they do not
      explicitly model the population structure.

TI  - Case-control association tests correcting for population stratification.
PG  - 98-115
AB  - In case-control association studies unobserved population stratification
      may act as a confounder, leading to an increased number of false positive
      results. Methods accounting for population structure by using additional
      genetic markers broadly follow one of two concepts: Genomic Control (GC)
      and Structured Association (SA). While extending existing methods of
      Structured Association we show that it is necessary to incorporate
      phenotypic information when inferring population structure, otherwise a
      systematic bias is introduced. Moreover, for moderate population
      stratification a Wald test statistic should be preferred as a Structured
      Association test statistic in comparison to a likelihood ratio test. The
      introduced extensions are compared to existing methods of Structured
      Association, as well as to Genomic Control, in a simulation study which is
      based on realistic situations of large case-control studies with moderate
      population stratification. A disadvantage of Genomic Control turns out to
      be the large variation in estimating the variance inflation factor, as
      well as the power loss if population structure increases. We come to the
      overall conclusion that Structured Association, if applied correctly, is
      superior to Genomic Control, at least in the case of simple population
      structure as simulated here.

TI  - A tutorial on statistical methods for population association studies.
PG  - 781-91
AB  - Although genetic association studies have been with us for many years,
      even for the simplest analyses there is little consensus on the most
      appropriate statistical procedures. Here I give an overview of statistical
      approaches to population association studies, including preliminary
      analyses (Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium testing, inference of phase and
      missing data, and SNP tagging), and single-SNP and multipoint tests for
      association. My goal is to outline the key methods with a brief discussion
      of problems (population structure and multiple testing), avenues for
      solutions and some ongoing developments.

TI  - Investigation of the ability of haplotype association and logistic
      regression to identify associated susceptibility loci.
PG  - 893-906
AB  - While finely spaced markers are increasingly being used in case-control
      association studies in attempts to identify susceptibility loci, not
      enough is yet known as to the optimal spacing of such markers, their
      likely power to detect association, the relative merits of single marker
      versus multimarker analysis, or which methods of analysis may be optimal.
      Some investigations of these issues have used markers simulated under
      different theoretical models of population evolution. However the HapMap
      project and other sources provide real datasets which can be used to
      obtain a more realistic view of the performance of these approaches. SNPs
      around APOE and from two HapMap regions were used to obtain information
      regarding linkage disequilibrium (LD) relationships between polymorphisms,
      and these real patterns of LD were used to simulate datasets such as would
      be obtained in case-control studies were these SNPs to influence
      susceptibility to disease. The datasets obtained were analysed using tests
      for heterogeneity of estimated haplotype frequencies and using logistic
      regression analyses in which only main effects from each marker were
      considered. All markers surrounding the putative susceptibility locus were
      analysed, using sets of either 1, 2, 3 or 4 markers at a time. Some
      markers within 150 kb of the susceptibility locus were able to detect
      association. At distances less than 100 kb there was no correlation
      between the distance from the susceptibility locus and the strength of
      evidence for association. When the average inter-locus spacing is 25 kb
      many loci would not be detected, while when the spacing is as low as 2 kb
      one can be fairly confident that at least one marker will be in strong
      enough LD with the susceptibility locus to enable association to be
      detected, if the susceptibility locus has a strong enough effect relative
      to the sample size. With an inter-locus spacing of 4 kb some
      susceptibility loci did not have a marker locus in strong LD, potentially
      undermining the ability to detect association. There was little difference
      in the performance of haplotype-based analysis compared with logistic
      regression considering effects of each marker as separate. Multimarker
      analysis on occasion produced results which were much more highly
      significant than single marker analysis, but only very rarely. Our results
      support the view that if markers are randomly selected then a spacing as
      low as 2 kb is desirable. Multimarker analysis can sometimes be more
      powerful than single marker analysis so both should be performed. However,
      because it is rare for multimarker analysis to be much more highly
      significant than single marker analysis one should strongly suspect that
      when such results occur they may be due to mistakes in genotyping or
      through some other artefact. Haplotype analysis may be more prone to such
      problems than logistic regression, suggesting that the latter method might
      be preferred.
