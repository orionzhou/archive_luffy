TI  - A comprehensive review of genetic association studies.
PG  - 45-61
AB  - Most common diseases are complex genetic traits, with multiple genetic and
      environmental components contributing to susceptibility. It has been
      proposed that common genetic variants, including single nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs), influence susceptibility to common disease. This
      proposal has begun to be tested in numerous studies of association between
      genetic variation at these common DNA polymorphisms and variation in
      disease susceptibility. We have performed an extensive review of such
      association studies. We find that over 600 positive associations between
      common gene variants and disease have been reported; these associations,
      if correct, would have tremendous importance for the prevention,
      prediction, and treatment of most common diseases. However, most reported
      associations are not robust: of the 166 putative associations which have
      been studied three or more times, only 6 have been consistently
      replicated. Interestingly, of the remaining 160 associations, well over
      half were observed again one or more times. We discuss the possible
      reasons for this irreproducibility and suggest guidelines for performing
      and interpreting genetic association studies. In particular, we emphasize
      the need for caution in drawing conclusions from a single report of an
      association between a genetic variant and disease susceptibility.

TI  - Meta-analysis of genetic association studies supports a contribution of
      common variants to susceptibility to common disease.
PG  - 177-82
AB  - Association studies offer a potentially powerful approach to identify
      genetic variants that influence susceptibility to common disease, but are
      plagued by the impression that they are not consistently reproducible. In
      principle, the inconsistency may be due to false positive studies, false
      negative studies or true variability in association among different
      populations. The critical question is whether false positives
      overwhelmingly explain the inconsistency. We analyzed 301 published
      studies covering 25 different reported associations. There was a large
      excess of studies replicating the first positive reports, inconsistent
      with the hypothesis of no true positive associations (P < 10(-14)). This
      excess of replications could not be reasonably explained by publication
      bias and was concentrated among 11 of the 25 associations. For 8 of these
      11 associations, pooled analysis of follow-up studies yielded
      statistically significant replication of the first report, with modest
      estimated genetic effects. Thus, a sizable fraction (but under half) of
      reported associations have strong evidence of replication; for these,
      false negative, underpowered studies probably contribute to inconsistent
      replication. We conclude that there are probably many common variants in
      the human genome with modest but real effects on common disease risk, and
      that studies using large samples will convincingly identify such variants.

PG  - 1045-51
AB  - Efforts to identify gene variants associated with susceptibility to common
      diseases use three approaches: pedigree and affected sib-pair linkage
      studies and association studies of population samples. The different aims
      of these study designs reflect their derivation from biological versus
      epidemiological traditions. Similar principles regarding determination of
      the evidence levels required to consider the results statistically
      significant apply to both linkage and association studies, however. Such
      determination requires explicit attention to the prior probability of
      particular findings, as well as appropriate correction for multiple
      comparisons. For most common diseases, increasing the sample size in a
      study is a crucial step in achieving statistically significant genetic
      mapping results. Recent studies suggest that the technology and
      statistical methodology will soon be available to make well-powered
      studies feasible using any of these approaches.

PG  - 95-108
AB  - Genetic factors strongly affect susceptibility to common diseases and also
      influence disease-related quantitative traits. Identifying the relevant
      genes has been difficult, in part because each causal gene only makes a
      small contribution to overall heritability. Genetic association studies
      offer a potentially powerful approach for mapping causal genes with modest
      effects, but are limited because only a small number of genes can be
      studied at a time. Genome-wide association studies will soon become
      possible, and could open new frontiers in our understanding and treatment
      of disease. However, the execution and analysis of such studies will
      require great care.

TI  - TAMAL: an integrated approach to choosing SNPs for genetic studies of
      human complex traits.
PG  - 626-7
AB  - SUMMARY: Investigators conducting studies of the molecular genetics of
      complex traits in humans often need rationally to select a set of single
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the hundreds or thousands available
      for a candidate gene. Accomplishing this requires integration of genomic
      data from distributed databases and is both time-consuming and
      error-prone. We developed the TAMAL (Technology And Money Are Limiting)
      web site to help identify promising SNPs for further investigation. For a
      given list of genes, TAMAL identifies SNPs that meet user-specified
      criteria (e.g. haplotype tagging SNPs or SNP predicted to lead to amino
      acid changes) from current versions of online resources (i.e. HapMap,
      Perlegen, Affymetrix, dbSNP and the UCSC genome browser). AVAILABILITY:
      TAMAL is a platform independent web-based application available free of
      charge at http://neoref.ils.unc.edu/tamal. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

TI  - PLINK: a tool set for whole-genome association and population-based
      linkage analyses.
PG  - 559-75
AB  - Whole-genome association studies (WGAS) bring new computational, as well
      as analytic, challenges to researchers. Many existing genetic-analysis
      tools are not designed to handle such large data sets in a convenient
      manner and do not necessarily exploit the new opportunities that
      whole-genome data bring. To address these issues, we developed PLINK, an
      open-source C/C++ WGAS tool set. With PLINK, large data sets comprising
      hundreds of thousands of markers genotyped for thousands of individuals
      can be rapidly manipulated and analyzed in their entirety. As well as
      providing tools to make the basic analytic steps computationally
      efficient, PLINK also supports some novel approaches to whole-genome data
      that take advantage of whole-genome coverage. We introduce PLINK and
      describe the five main domains of function: data management, summary
      statistics, population stratification, association analysis, and
      identity-by-descent estimation. In particular, we focus on the estimation
      and use of identity-by-state and identity-by-descent information in the
      context of population-based whole-genome studies. This information can be
      used to detect and correct for population stratification and to identify
      extended chromosomal segments that are shared identical by descent between
      very distantly related individuals. Analysis of the patterns of segmental
      sharing has the potential to map disease loci that contain multiple rare
      variants in a population-based linkage analysis.

TI  - Genomewide weighted hypothesis testing in family-based association
      studies, with an application to a 100K scan.
PG  - 607-14
AB  - For genomewide association (GWA) studies in family-based designs, we
      propose a novel two-stage strategy that weighs the association P values
      with the use of independently estimated weights. The association
      information contained in the family sample is partitioned into two
      orthogonal components--namely, the between-family information and the
      within-family information. The between-family component is used in the
      first (i.e., screening) stage to obtain a relative ranking of all the
      markers. The within-family component is used in the second (i.e., testing)
      stage in the framework of the standard family-based association test, and
      the resulting P values are weighted using the estimated marker ranking
      from the screening step. The approach is appealing, in that it ensures
      that all the markers are tested in the testing step and, at the same time,
      also uses information from the screening step. Through simulation studies,
      we show that testing all the markers is more powerful than testing only
      the most promising ones from the screening step, which was the method
      suggested by Van Steen et al. A comparison with a population-based
      approach shows that the approach achieves comparable power. In the
      presence of a reasonable level of population stratification, our approach
      is only slightly affected in terms of power and, since it is a
      family-based method, is completely robust to spurious effects. An
      application to a 100K scan in the Framingham Heart Study illustrates the
      practical advantages of our approach. The proposed method is of general
      applicability; it extends to any setting in which prior, independent
      ranking of hypotheses is available.
