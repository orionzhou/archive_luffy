TI  - Haplotype block partitioning and tag SNP selection using genotype data and
      their applications to association studies.
PG  - 908-16
AB  - Recent studies have revealed that linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns
      vary across the human genome with some regions of high LD interspersed by
      regions of low LD. A small fraction of SNPs (tag SNPs) is sufficient to
      capture most of the haplotype structure of the human genome. In this
      paper, we develop a method to partition haplotypes into blocks and to
      identify tag SNPs based on genotype data by combining a dynamic
      programming algorithm for haplotype block partitioning and tag SNP
      selection based on haplotype data with a variation of the expectation
      maximization (EM) algorithm for haplotype inference. We assess the effects
      of using either haplotype or genotype data in haplotype block
      identification and tag SNP selection as a function of several factors,
      including sample size, density or number of SNPs studied, allele
      frequencies, fraction of missing data, and genotyping error rate, using
      extensive simulations. We find that a modest number of haplotype or
      genotype samples will result in consistent block partitions and tag SNP
      selection. The power of association studies based on tag SNPs using
      genotype data is similar to that using haplotype data.

TI  - Optimal haplotype block-free selection of tagging SNPs for genome-wide
      association studies.
PG  - 1633-40
AB  - It is widely hoped that the study of sequence variation in the human
      genome will provide a means of elucidating the genetic component of
      complex diseases and variable drug responses. A major stumbling block to
      the successful design and execution of genome-wide disease association
      studies using single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and linkage
      disequilibrium is the enormous number of SNPs in the human genome. This
      results in unacceptably high costs for exhaustive genotyping and presents
      a challenging problem of statistical inference. Here, we present a new
      method for optimally selecting minimum informative subsets of SNPs, also
      known as "tagging" SNPs, that is efficient for genome-wide selection. We
      contrast this method to published methods including haplotype block
      tagging, that is, grouping SNPs into segments of low haplotype diversity
      and typing a subset of the SNPs that can discriminate all common
      haplotypes within the blocks. Because our method does not rely on a
      predefined haplotype block structure and makes use of the weaker
      correlations that occur across neighboring blocks, it can be effectively
      applied across chromosomal regions with both high and low local linkage
      disequilibrium. We show that the number of tagging SNPs selected is
      substantially smaller than previously reported using block-based
      approaches and that selecting tagging SNPs optimally can result in a two-
      to threefold savings over selecting random SNPs.

TI  - Optimal selection of SNP markers for disease association studies.
PG  - 190-202
AB  - Genetic association studies with population samples hold the promise of
      uncovering the susceptibility genes underlying the heritability of complex
      or common disease. Most association studies rely on the use of surrogate
      markers, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) being the most suitable due
      to their abundance and ease of scoring. SNP marker selection is aimed to
      increase the chances that at least one typed SNP would be in linkage
      disequilibrium (LD) with the disease causative variant, while at the same
      time controlling the cost of the study in terms of the number of markers
      genotyped and samples. Empirical studies reporting block-like segments in
      the genome with high LD and low haplotype diversity have motivated a
      marker selection strategy whereby subsets of SNPs that 'tag' the common
      haplotypes of a region are picked for genotyping, avoiding typing
      redundant SNPs. Based on these initial observations, a plethora of
      'tagging' algorithms for selecting minimum informative subsets of SNPs has
      recently appeared in the literature. These differ mostly in two major
      aspects: the quality or correlation measure used to define tagging and the
      algorithm used for the minimization of the final number of tagging SNPs.
      In this review we describe the available tagging algorithms utilizing a
      3-step unifying framework, point out their methodological and conceptual
      differences, and make an assessment of their assumptions, performance, and
      scalability.

AB  - With recent advances in high-throughput single nucleotide polymorphism
      (SNP) typing technologies, genome-wide association studies have become a
      realistic approach to identify the causative genes that are responsible
      for common diseases of complex genetic traits. In this strategy, a
      trade-off between the increased genome coverage and a chance of finding
      SNPs incidentally showing a large statistics becomes serious due to
      extreme multiple-hypothesis testing. We investigated the extent to which
      this trade-off limits the genome-wide power with this approach by
      simulating a large number of case-control panels based on the empirical
      data from the HapMap Project. In our simulations, statistical costs of
      multiple hypothesis testing were evaluated by empirically calculating
      distributions of the maximum value of the chi(2) statistics for a series
      of marker sets having increasing numbers of SNPs, which were used to
      determine a genome-wide threshold in the following power simulations. With
      a practical study size, the cost of multiple testing largely offsets the
      potential benefits from increased genome coverage given modest genetic
      effects and/or low frequencies of causal alleles. In most realistic
      scenarios, increasing genome coverage becomes less influential on the
      power, while sample size is the predominant determinant of the feasibility
      of genome-wide association tests. Increasing genome coverage without
      corresponding increase in sample size will only consume resources without
      little gain in power. For common causal alleles with relatively large
      effect sizes [genotype relative risk > or =1.7], we can expect
      satisfactory power with currently available large-scale genotyping
      platforms using realistic sample size ( approximately 1000 per arm).

TI  - Efficacy assessment of SNP sets for genome-wide disease association
      studies.
PG  - e113
AB  - The power of a genome-wide disease association study depends critically
      upon the properties of the marker set used, particularly the number and
      physical spacing of markers, and the level of inter-marker association due
      to linkage disequilibrium. Extending our previously devised theoretical
      framework for the entropy-based selection of genetic markers, we have
      developed a local measure of the efficacy of a marker set, relative to
      including a maximally polymorphic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at
      the map position of interest. Using this quantitative criterion, we
      evaluated five currently available SNP sets, namely Affymetrix 100K and
      500K, and Illumina 100K, 300K and 550K in the CEU, YRI and JPT + CHB
      HapMap populations. At 50% relative efficacy, the commercial marker sets
      cover between 19 and 68% of the human genome, depending upon the
      population under study. An optimal technology-independent 500K marker set
      constructed from HapMap for Caucasians, in contrast, would achieve 73%
      coverage at the same relative efficacy.

TI  - Genetic model selection in two-phase analysis for case control association
      studies.
AB  - The Cochran-Armitage trend test (CATT) is well suited for testing
      association between a marker and a disease in case-control studies. When
      the underlying genetic model for the disease is known, the CATT optimal
      for the genetic model is used. For complex diseases, however, the genetic
      models of the true disease loci are unknown. In this situation, robust
      tests are preferable. We propose a two-phase analysis with model selection
      for the case-control design. In the first phase, we use the difference of
      Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium coefficients between the cases and the
      controls for model selection. Then, an optimal CATT corresponding to the
      selected model is used for testing association. The correlation of the
      statistics used for selection and the test for association is derived to
      adjust the two-phase analysis with control of the Type-I error rate. The
      simulation studies show that this new approach has greater efficiency
      robustness than the existing methods.
