TI  - Evaluating HapMap SNP data transferability in a large-scale genotyping
      project involving 175 cancer-associated genes.
PG  - 669-79
AB  - One of the many potential uses of the HapMap project is its application to
      the investigation of complex disease aetiology among a wide range of
      populations. This study aims to assess the transferability of HapMap SNP
      data to the Spanish population in the context of cancer research. We have
      carried out a genotyping study in Spanish subjects involving 175 candidate
      cancer genes using an indirect gene-based approach and compared results
      with those for HapMap CEU subjects. Allele frequencies were very
      consistent between the two samples, with a high positive correlation (R)
      of 0.91 (P<<1x10(-6)). Linkage disequilibrium patterns and block
      structures across each gene were also very similar, with disequilibrium
      coefficient (r (2)) highly correlated (R=0.95, P<<1x10(-6)). We found that
      of the 21 genes that contained at least one block larger than 60 kb, nine
      (ATM, ATR, BRCA1, ERCC6, FANCC, RAD17, RAD50, RAD54B and XRCC4) belonged
      to the GO category "DNA repair". Haplotype frequencies per gene were also
      highly correlated (mean R=0.93), as was haplotype diversity (R=0.91,
      P<<1x10(-6)). "Yin yang" haplotypes were observed for 43% of the genes
      analysed and 18% of those were identical to the ancestral haplotype
      (identified in Chimpazee). Finally, the portability of tagSNPs identified
      in the HapMap CEU data using pairwise r (2) thresholds of 0.8 and 0.5 was
      assessed by applying these to the Spanish and current HapMap data for 66
      genes. In general, the HapMap tagSNPs performed very well. Our results
      show generally high concordance with HapMap data in allele frequencies and
      haplotype distributions and confirm the applicability of HapMap SNP data
      to the study of complex diseases among the Spanish population.

TI  - The SNPlex genotyping system: a flexible and scalable platform for SNP
      genotyping.
PG  - 398-406
AB  - We developed the SNPlex Genotyping System to address the need for accurate
      genotyping data, high sample throughput, study design flexibility, and
      cost efficiency. The system uses oligonucleotide ligation/polymerase chain
      reaction and capillary electrophoresis to analyze bi-allelic single
      nucleotide polymorphism genotypes. It is well suited for single nucleotide
      polymorphism genotyping efforts in which throughput and cost efficiency
      are essential. The SNPlex Genotyping System offers a high degree of
      flexibility and scalability, allowing the selection of custom-defined sets
      of SNPs for medium- to high-throughput genotyping projects. It is
      therefore suitable for a broad range of study designs. In this article we
      describe the principle and applications of the SNPlex Genotyping System,
      as well as a set of single nucleotide polymorphism selection tools and
      validated assay resources that accelerate the assay design process. We
      developed the control pool, an oligonucleotide ligation probe set for
      training and quality-control purposes, which interrogates 48 SNPs
      simultaneously. We present performance data from this control pool
      obtained by testing genomic DNA samples from 44 individuals. in addition,
      we present data from a study that analyzed 521 SNPs in 92 individuals.
      Combined, both studies show the SNPlex Genotyping system to have a 99.32%
      overall call rate, 99.95% precision, and 99.84% concordance with genotypes
      analyzed by TaqMan probe-based assays. The SNPlex Genotyping System is an
      efficient and reliable tool for a broad range of genotyping applications,
      supported by applications for study design, data analysis, and data
      management.

TI  - An evaluation of the performance of tag SNPs derived from HapMap in a
      Caucasian population.
PG  - e27
AB  - The Haplotype Map (HapMap) project recently generated genotype data for
      more than 1 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in four
      population samples. The main application of the data is in the selection
      of tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (tSNPs) to use in association
      studies. The usefulness of this selection process needs to be verified in
      populations outside those used for the HapMap project. In addition, it is
      not known how well the data represent the general population, as only
      90-120 chromosomes were used for each population and since the genotyped
      SNPs were selected so as to have high frequencies. In this study, we
      analyzed more than 1,000 individuals from Estonia. The population of this
      northern European country has been influenced by many different waves of
      migrations from Europe and Russia. We genotyped 1,536 randomly selected
      SNPs from two 500-kbp ENCODE regions on Chromosome 2. We observed that the
      tSNPs selected from the CEPH (Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain) from
      Utah (CEU) HapMap samples (derived from US residents with northern and
      western European ancestry) captured most of the variation in the Estonia
      sample. (Between 90% and 95% of the SNPs with a minor allele frequency of
      more than 5% have an r2 of at least 0.8 with one of the CEU tSNPs.) Using
      the reverse approach, tags selected from the Estonia sample could almost
      equally well describe the CEU sample. Finally, we observed that the sample
      size, the allelic frequency, and the SNP density in the dataset used to
      select the tags each have important effects on the tagging performance.
      Overall, our study supports the use of HapMap data in other Caucasian
      populations, but the SNP density and the bias towards high-frequency SNPs
      have to be taken into account when designing association studies.

PG  - 535-43
AB  - One of the crucial issues of association studies is the selection of
      markers. One possible approach would be to select tagging SNPs (tSNPs)
      according the HapMap information. In this study we present the number of
      tSNPs required for the association analysis of the entire human genome for
      all available HapMap population samples: CEPH, Nigerian, Chinese and
      Japanese. For future association studies, it is also important to know how
      well the tSNP set of one population sample can describe the markers of
      another population. Therefore, we have calculated the proportion of
      markers adequately described by tSNPs and how many additional tSNPs we
      need to describe all markers of another population.
