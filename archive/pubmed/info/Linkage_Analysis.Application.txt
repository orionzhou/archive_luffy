TI  - Genomewide linkage analysis of stature in multiple populations reveals
      several regions with evidence of linkage to adult height.
PG  - 106-16
AB  - Genomewide linkage analysis has been extremely successful at
      identification of the genetic variation underlying single-gene disorders.
      However, linkage analysis has been less successful for common human
      diseases and other complex traits in which multiple genetic and
      environmental factors interact to influence disease risk. We hypothesized
      that a highly heritable complex trait, in which the contribution of
      environmental factors was relatively limited, might be more amenable to
      linkage analysis. We therefore chose to study stature (adult height), for
      which heritability is approximately 75%-90% (Phillips and Matheny 1990;
      Carmichael and McGue 1995; Preece 1996; Silventoinen et al. 2000). We
      reanalyzed genomewide scans from four populations for which genotype and
      height data were available, using a variance-components method implemented
      in GENEHUNTER 2.0 (Pratt et al. 2000). The populations consisted of 408
      individuals in 58 families from the Botnia region of Finland, 753
      individuals in 183 families from other parts of Finland, 746 individuals
      in 179 families from Southern Sweden, and 420 individuals in 63 families
      from the Saguenay-Lac-St.-Jean region of Quebec. Four regions showed
      evidence of linkage to stature: 6q24-25, multipoint LOD score 3.85 at
      marker D6S1007 in Botnia (genomewide P<.06), 7q31.3-36 (LOD 3.40 at marker
      D7S2195 in Sweden, P<.02), 12p11.2-q14 (LOD 3.35 at markers
      D12S10990-D12S398 in Finland, P<.05) and 13q32-33 (LOD 3.56 at markers
      D13S779-D13S797 in Finland, P<.05). In a companion article (Perola et al.
      2001 [in this issue]), strong supporting evidence is obtained for linkage
      to the region on chromosome 7. These studies suggest that highly heritable
      complex traits such as stature may be genetically tractable and provide
      insight into the genetic architecture of complex traits.

TI  - Linkage analysis of HLA and candidate genes for celiac disease in a North
      American family-based study.
PG  - 12
AB  - BACKGROUND: Celiac disease has a strong genetic association with HLA.
      However, this association only explains approximately half of the sibling
      risk for celiac disease. Therefore, other genes must be involved in
      susceptibility to celiac disease. We tested for linkage to genes or loci
      that could play a role in pathogenesis of celiac disease. METHODS: DNA
      samples, from members of 62 families with a minimum of two cases of celiac
      disease, were genotyped at HLA and at 13 candidate gene regions, including
      CD4, CTLA4, four T-cell receptor regions, and 7 insulin-dependent diabetes
      regions. Two-point and multipoint heterogeneity LOD (HLOD) scores were
      examined. RESULTS: The highest two-point and multipoint HLOD scores were
      obtained in the HLA region, with a two-point HLOD of 3.1 and a multipoint
      HLOD of 5.0. For the candidate genes, we found no evidence for linkage.
      CONCLUSIONS: Our significant evidence of linkage to HLA replicates the
      known linkage and association of HLA with CD. In our families, likely
      candidate genes did not explain the susceptibility to celiac disease.

TI  - Ordered-subsets linkage analysis detects novel Alzheimer disease loci on
      chromosomes 2q34 and 15q22.
PG  - 1041-51
AB  - Alzheimer disease (AD) is a complex disorder characterized by a wide
      range, within and between families, of ages at onset of symptoms.
      Consideration of age at onset as a covariate in genetic-linkage studies
      may reduce genetic heterogeneity and increase statistical power.
      Ordered-subsets analysis includes continuous covariates in linkage
      analysis by rank ordering families by a covariate and summing LOD scores
      to find a subset giving a significantly increased LOD score relative to
      the overall sample. We have analyzed data from 336 markers in 437
      multiplex (>/=2 sampled individuals with AD) families included in a recent
      genomic screen for AD loci. To identify genetic heterogeneity by age at
      onset, families were ordered by increasing and decreasing mean and minimum
      ages at onset. Chromosomewide significance of increases in the LOD score
      in subsets relative to the overall sample was assessed by permutation. A
      statistically significant increase in the nonparametric multipoint LOD
      score was observed on chromosome 2q34, with a peak LOD score of 3.2 at
      D2S2944 (P=.008) in 31 families with a minimum age at onset between 50 and
      60 years. The LOD score in the chromosome 9p region previously linked to
      AD increased to 4.6 at D9S741 (P=.01) in 334 families with minimum age at
      onset between 60 and 75 years. LOD scores were also significantly
      increased on chromosome 15q22: a peak LOD score of 2.8 (P=.0004) was
      detected at D15S1507 (60 cM) in 38 families with minimum age at onset
      >/=79 years, and a peak LOD score of 3.1 (P=.0006) was obtained at D15S153
      (62 cM) in 43 families with mean age at onset >80 years. Thirty-one
      families were contained in both 15q22 subsets, indicating that these
      results are likely detecting the same locus. There is little overlap in
      these subsets, underscoring the utility of age at onset as a marker of
      genetic heterogeneity. These results indicate that linkage to chromosome
      9p is strongest in late-onset AD and that regions on chromosome 2q34 and
      15q22 are linked to early-onset AD and very-late-onset AD, respectively.

TI  - A quantitative linkage score for an association study following a linkage
      analysis.
PG  - 5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Currently, a commonly used strategy for mapping complex
      quantitative traits is to use a genome-wide linkage analysis to narrow
      suspected genes to regions on a scale of centiMorgans (cM), followed by an
      association analysis to fine map the genetic variation in regions showing
      linkage. Two important questions arise in the design and the resulting
      inference at the association stage of this sequential procedure: (1) how
      should we design an efficient association study given the information
      provided by the previous linkage study? and (2) can an association in a
      linkage region explain, in part, the detected linkage signal? RESULTS: We
      derive a quantitative linkage score (QLS) based on Haseman-Elston
      regression (Haseman and Elston 1972) and make use of this score to address
      both questions. In designing an association study, the selection of a
      subsample from the linkage study sample can be guided by the linkage
      information summarized in the QLS. When heterogeneity exists, we show that
      selection based on the QLS can increase the proportion of sample
      individuals from the subpopulation affected by a disease allele and
      therefore greatly improves the power of the association study. For the
      resulting inference, we frame as a hypothesis test the question of whether
      a linkage signal in a region can be in part explained by a marker allele.
      A simple one sided paired t-statistic is defined by comparing the two sets
      of QLSs obtained with/without modeling a marker association: a significant
      difference indicates that the marker can at least partly account for the
      detected linkage. We also show that this statistic can be used to detect a
      spurious association. CONCLUSION: All our results suggest that a careful
      examination of QLSs should be helpful for understanding the results of
      both association and linkage studies.

TI  - Linkage analysis of quantitative traits for obesity, diabetes,
      hypertension, and dyslipidemia on the island of Kosrae, Federated States
      of Micronesia.
PG  - 3502-9
AB  - Obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease are highly heritable
      conditions that in aggregate are the major causes of morbidity and
      mortality in the developed world and are growing problems in developing
      countries. To map the causal genes, we conducted a population screen for
      these conditions on the Pacific Island of Kosrae. Family history and
      genetic data were used to construct a pedigree for the island. Analysis of
      the pedigree showed highly significant heritability for the metabolic
      traits under study. DNA samples from 2,188 participants were genotyped
      with 405 microsatellite markers with an average intermarker distance of 11
      cM. A protocol using loki, a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling method, was
      developed to analyze the Kosraen pedigree for height, a model quantitative
      trait. Robust quantitative trait loci for height were found on 10q21 and
      1p31. This protocol was used to map a set of metabolic traits, including
      plasma leptin to chromosome region 5q35; systolic blood pressure to 20p12;
      total cholesterol to 19p13, 12q24, and 16qter; hip circumference to 10q25
      and 4q23; body mass index to 18p11 and 20q13; apolipoprotein B to 2p24-25;
      weight to 18q21; and fasting blood sugar to 1q31-1q43. Several of these
      same chromosomal regions have been identified in previous studies
      validating the use of loki. These studies add information about the
      genetics of the metabolic syndrome and establish an analytical approach
      for linkage analysis of complex pedigrees. These results also lay the
      foundation for whole genome scans with dense sets of SNPs aimed to
      identifying causal genes.

TI  - The cluster variation method for efficient linkage analysis on extended
      pedigrees.
PG  - S1
AB  - BACKGROUND: Computing exact multipoint LOD scores for extended pedigrees
      rapidly becomes infeasible as the number of markers and untyped
      individuals increase. When markers are excluded from the computation,
      significant power may be lost. Therefore accurate approximate methods
      which take into account all markers are desirable. METHODS: We present a
      novel method for efficient estimation of LOD scores on extended pedigrees.
      Our approach is based on the Cluster Variation Method, which
      deterministically estimates likelihoods by performing exact computations
      on tractable subsets of variables (clusters) of a Bayesian network. First
      a distribution over inheritances on the marker loci is approximated with
      the Cluster Variation Method. Then this distribution is used to estimate
      the LOD score for each location of the trait locus. RESULTS: First we
      demonstrate that significant power may be lost if markers are ignored in
      the multi-point analysis. On a set of pedigrees where exact computation is
      possible we compare the estimates of the LOD scores obtained with our
      method to the exact LOD scores. Secondly, we compare our method to a state
      of the art MCMC sampler. When both methods are given equal computation
      time, our method is more efficient. Finally, we show that CVM scales to
      large problem instances. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the Cluster
      Variation Method is as accurate as MCMC and generally is more efficient.
      Our method is a promising alternative to approaches based on MCMC
      sampling.

AB  - Although balancing selection with the sickle-cell trait and other red
      blood cell disorders has emphasized the interaction between malaria and
      human genetics, no systematic approach has so far been undertaken towards
      a comprehensive search for human genome variants influencing malaria. By
      screening 2,551 families in rural Ghana, West Africa, 108 nuclear families
      were identified who were exposed to hyperendemic malaria transmission and
      were homozygous wild-type for the established malaria resistance factors
      of hemoglobin (Hb)S, HbC, alpha(+) thalassemia, and
      glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase deficiency. Of these families, 392
      siblings aged 0.5-11 y were characterized for malaria susceptibility by
      closely monitoring parasite counts, malaria fever episodes, and anemia
      over 8 mo. An autosome-wide linkage analysis based on 10,000
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms was conducted in 68 selected families
      including 241 siblings forming 330 sib pairs. Several regions were
      identified which showed evidence for linkage to the parasitological and
      clinical phenotypes studied, among them a prominent signal on Chromosome
      10p15 obtained with malaria fever episodes (asymptotic z score = 4.37,
      empirical p-value = 4.0 x 10(-5), locus-specific heritability of 37.7%;
      95% confidence interval, 15.7%-59.7%). The identification of genetic
      variants underlying the linkage signals may reveal as yet unrecognized
      pathways influencing human resistance to malaria.

TI  - Linkage analysis of schizophrenia with five dopamine receptor genes in
      nine pedigrees.
PG  - 327-34
AB  - Alterations in dopamine neurotransmission have been strongly implicated in
      the pathogenesis of schizophrenia for nearly 2 decades. Recently, the
      genes for five dopamine receptors have been cloned and characterized, and
      genetic and physical map information has become available. Using these
      five loci as candidate genes, we have tested for genetic linkage to
      schizophrenia in nine multigenerational families which include multiple
      affected individuals. In addition to testing conservative disease models,
      we have used a neurophysiological indicator variable, the P50 auditory
      evoked response. Deficits in gating of the P50 response have been shown to
      segregate with schizophrenia in this sample and may identify carriers of
      gene(s) predisposing for schizophrenia. Linkage results were consistently
      negative, indicating that a defect at any of the actual receptor sites is
      unlikely to be a major contributor to schizophrenia in the nine families
      studied.
