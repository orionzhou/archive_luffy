TI  - 'Mendelian randomization': can genetic epidemiology contribute to
      understanding environmental determinants of disease?
PG  - 1-22
AB  - Associations between modifiable exposures and disease seen in
      observational epidemiology are sometimes confounded and thus misleading,
      despite our best efforts to improve the design and analysis of studies.
      Mendelian randomization-the random assortment of genes from parents to
      offspring that occurs during gamete formation and conception-provides one
      method for assessing the causal nature of some environmental exposures.
      The association between a disease and a polymorphism that mimics the
      biological link between a proposed exposure and disease is not generally
      susceptible to the reverse causation or confounding that may distort
      interpretations of conventional observational studies. Several examples
      where the phenotypic effects of polymorphisms are well documented provide
      encouraging evidence of the explanatory power of Mendelian randomization
      and are described. The limitations of the approach include confounding by
      polymorphisms in linkage disequilibrium with the polymorphism under study,
      that polymorphisms may have several phenotypic effects associated with
      disease, the lack of suitable polymorphisms for studying modifiable
      exposures of interest, and canalization-the buffering of the effects of
      genetic variation during development. Nevertheless, Mendelian
      randomization provides new opportunities to test causality and
      demonstrates how investment in the human genome project may contribute to
      understanding and preventing the adverse effects on human health of
      modifiable exposures.

TI  - Selection bias in the assessment of gene-environment interaction in
      case-control studies.
PG  - 259-63
AB  - Selection bias is a common concern in epidemiologic studies, particularly
      case-control studies. Selection bias in the odds ratio occurs when
      participation depends jointly on exposure and disease status. General
      results for understanding when selection bias may affect studies involving
      gene-environment interactions have not yet been developed. In this paper,
      the authors show that the assessment of gene-environment interactions will
      not be subject to selection bias under the assumption that genotype does
      not influence participation conditional on exposure and disease status.
      This is true even when selection, including self-selection of subjects, is
      jointly influenced by exposure and disease and regardless of whether the
      genotype is related to exposure, disease, or both. The authors present an
      example to illustrate this concept.

TI  - Genetic variation and willingness to participate in epidemiologic
      research: data from three studies.
PG  - 2449-53
AB  - The differences in common genetic polymorphism frequencies by willingness
      to participate in epidemiologic studies are unexplored, but the same
      threats to internal validity operate as for studies with nongenetic
      information. We analyzed single nucleotide polymorphism genotypes,
      haplotypes, and short tandem repeats among control groups from three
      studies with different recruitment designs that included early, late, and
      never questionnaire responders, one or more participation incentives, and
      blood or buccal DNA collection. Among 2,955 individuals, we compared 108
      genotypes, 8 haplotypes, and 9 to 15 short tandem repeats by respondent
      type. Among our main comparisons, single nucleotide polymorphism genotype
      frequencies differed significantly (P < 0.05) between respondent groups in
      six instances, with 13 expected by chance alone. When comparing the odds
      of carrying a variant among the various response groups, 19 odds ratios
      were </=0.70 or >/=1.40, levels that might be notably different. Among the
      various respondent group comparisons, haplotype and short tandem repeat
      frequencies were not significantly different by willingness to
      participate. We observed little evidence to suggest that genotype
      differences underlie response characteristics in molecular epidemiologic
      studies, but a greater variety of genes should be examined, including
      those related to behavioral traits potentially associated with willingness
      to participate. To the extent possible, investigators should evaluate
      their own genetic data for bias in response categories.

TI  - Local literature bias in genetic epidemiology: an empirical evaluation of
      the Chinese literature.
PG  - e334
AB  - BACKGROUND: Postulated epidemiological associations are subject to several
      biases. We evaluated whether the Chinese literature on human genome
      epidemiology may offer insights on the operation of selective reporting
      and language biases. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We targeted 13 gene-disease
      associations, each already assessed by meta-analyses, including at least
      15 non-Chinese studies. We searched the Chinese Journal Full-Text Database
      for additional Chinese studies on the same topics. We identified 161
      Chinese studies on 12 of these gene-disease associations; only 20 were
      PubMed-indexed (seven English full-text). Many studies (14-35 per topic)
      were available for six topics, covering diseases common in China. With one
      exception, the first Chinese study appeared with a time lag (2-21 y) after
      the first non-Chinese study on the topic. Chinese studies showed
      significantly more prominent genetic effects than non-Chinese studies, and
      48% were statistically significant per se, despite their smaller sample
      size (median sample size 146 versus 268, p < 0.001). The largest genetic
      effects were often seen in PubMed-indexed Chinese studies (65%
      statistically significant per se). Non-Chinese studies of Asian-descent
      populations (27% significant per se) also tended to show somewhat more
      prominent genetic effects than studies of non-Asian descent (17%
      significant per se). CONCLUSION: Our data provide evidence for the
      interplay of selective reporting and language biases in human genome
      epidemiology. These biases may not be limited to the Chinese literature
      and point to the need for a global, transparent, comprehensive outlook in
      molecular population genetics and epidemiologic studies in general.
