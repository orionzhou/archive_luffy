AB  - The rapid growth of human genetics creates countless opportunities for
      studies of disease association. Given the number of potentially
      identifiable genetic markers and the multitude of clinical outcomes to
      which these may be linked, the testing and validation of statistical
      hypotheses in genetic epidemiology is a task of unprecedented scale.
      Meta-analysis provides a quantitative approach for combining the results
      of various studies on the same topic, and for estimating and explaining
      their diversity. Here, we have evaluated by meta-analysis 370 studies
      addressing 36 genetic associations for various outcomes of disease. We
      show that significant between-study heterogeneity (diversity) is frequent,
      and that the results of the first study correlate only modestly with
      subsequent research on the same association. The first study often
      suggests a stronger genetic effect than is found by subsequent studies.
      Both bias and genuine population diversity might explain why early
      association studies tend to overestimate the disease protection or
      predisposition conferred by a genetic polymorphism. We conclude that a
      systematic meta-analytic approach may assist in estimating population-wide
      effects of genetic risk factors in human disease.

TI  - A comprehensive review of genetic association studies.
PG  - 45-61
AB  - Most common diseases are complex genetic traits, with multiple genetic and
      environmental components contributing to susceptibility. It has been
      proposed that common genetic variants, including single nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs), influence susceptibility to common disease. This
      proposal has begun to be tested in numerous studies of association between
      genetic variation at these common DNA polymorphisms and variation in
      disease susceptibility. We have performed an extensive review of such
      association studies. We find that over 600 positive associations between
      common gene variants and disease have been reported; these associations,
      if correct, would have tremendous importance for the prevention,
      prediction, and treatment of most common diseases. However, most reported
      associations are not robust: of the 166 putative associations which have
      been studied three or more times, only 6 have been consistently
      replicated. Interestingly, of the remaining 160 associations, well over
      half were observed again one or more times. We discuss the possible
      reasons for this irreproducibility and suggest guidelines for performing
      and interpreting genetic association studies. In particular, we emphasize
      the need for caution in drawing conclusions from a single report of an
      association between a genetic variant and disease susceptibility.

TI  - Meta-analysis of genetic association studies supports a contribution of
      common variants to susceptibility to common disease.
PG  - 177-82
AB  - Association studies offer a potentially powerful approach to identify
      genetic variants that influence susceptibility to common disease, but are
      plagued by the impression that they are not consistently reproducible. In
      principle, the inconsistency may be due to false positive studies, false
      negative studies or true variability in association among different
      populations. The critical question is whether false positives
      overwhelmingly explain the inconsistency. We analyzed 301 published
      studies covering 25 different reported associations. There was a large
      excess of studies replicating the first positive reports, inconsistent
      with the hypothesis of no true positive associations (P < 10(-14)). This
      excess of replications could not be reasonably explained by publication
      bias and was concentrated among 11 of the 25 associations. For 8 of these
      11 associations, pooled analysis of follow-up studies yielded
      statistically significant replication of the first report, with modest
      estimated genetic effects. Thus, a sizable fraction (but under half) of
      reported associations have strong evidence of replication; for these,
      false negative, underpowered studies probably contribute to inconsistent
      replication. We conclude that there are probably many common variants in
      the human genome with modest but real effects on common disease risk, and
      that studies using large samples will convincingly identify such variants.

TI  - Gene-environment interactions in human diseases.
PG  - 287-98
AB  - Studies of gene-environment interactions aim to describe how genetic and
      environmental factors jointly influence the risk of developing a human
      disease. Gene-environment interactions can be described by using several
      models, which take into account the various ways in which genetic effects
      can be modified by environmental exposures, the number of levels of these
      exposures and the model on which the genetic effects are based. Choice of
      study design, sample size and genotyping technology influence the analysis
      and interpretation of observed gene-environment interactions. Current
      systems for reporting epidemiological studies make it difficult to assess
      whether the observed interactions are reproducible, so suggestions are
      made for improvements in this area.

TI  - Early extreme contradictory estimates may appear in published research:
      the Proteus phenomenon in molecular genetics research and randomized
      trials.
PG  - 543-9
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Divergent results on the same scientific
      question generate controversy. We hypothesized that controversial data are
      attractive to investigators and editors, and thus the most extreme,
      opposite results would appear very early rather than late, as data
      accumulate, provided data can be generated rapidly. METHODS: We used data
      from MEDLINE-indexed meta-analyses of case-control studies on genetic
      associations (retrospective, hypothesis-generating research with usually
      rapid turnaround) and meta-analyses of randomized trials of health care
      interventions (prospective, targeted research that usually takes longer)
      sampled from the Cochrane Library. Using cumulative meta-analysis, we
      evaluated how the between-study variance for studies on the same question
      changed over time and at what point the studies with the most extreme
      results ever observed had been published. RESULTS: The maximal
      between-study variance was more likely to be recorded early in the 44
      eligible meta-analyses of genetic associations than in the 37
      meta-analyses of health care interventions (P = .013). At the time of the
      first heterogeneity assessment, the most favorable-ever result in support
      of a specific association was more likely to appear than the least
      favorable-ever result (22 vs. 10, P = .017); the opposite was seen at the
      second heterogeneity assessment (15 vs. 5, P = .031). Such a sequence of
      extreme opposite results was not seen in the clinical trials
      meta-analyses. The estimated between-study variance decreased over time in
      genetic association studies (P = .010), but not in clinical trials (P =
      .30). CONCLUSION: In contrast to prospective trials, a rapid early
      sequence of extreme, opposite results is frequent in retrospective
      hypothesis-generating molecular research.

TI  - Non-replication and inconsistency in the genome-wide association setting.
PG  - 203-13
AB  - Non-replication and inconsistency had been common features in the search
      for common variants of candidate genes affecting the risk of complex
      diseases. They may continue to require attention in the current era, when
      massive hypothesis-free testing of genetic variants is feasible. An
      empirical evaluation of the early experience with genome-wide association
      (GWA) studies suggests several examples where proposed associations have
      failed to be replicated by subsequent investigations. Non-replication and
      inconsistency is defined here in the framework of cumulative
      meta-analysis. Ideally, associations exist, GWA finds them, and subsequent
      investigations should replicate them. However, a number of other
      possibilities need to be considered. No common genetic variants may
      associate with the phenotype of interest and GWA may find nothing; or
      associations may exist, but GWA may miss them. Associations that do not
      exist may be falsely selected by the GWA and subsequent studies may
      appropriately refute them or falsely replicate them. Finally, GWA may find
      true associations that are nevertheless falsely non-replicated in the
      subsequent studies; or associations may be genuinely inconsistent across
      study populations. A list of options is presented for consideration in
      each of these scenarios.

TI  - Flexible design for following up positive findings.
PG  - 540-51
AB  - As more population-based studies suggest associations between genetic
      variants and disease risk, there is a need to improve the design of
      follow-up studies (stage II) in independent samples to confirm evidence of
      association observed at the initial stage (stage I). We propose to use
      flexible designs developed for randomized clinical trials in the
      calculation of sample size for follow-up studies. We apply a bootstrap
      procedure to correct the effect of regression to the mean, also called
      "winner's curse," resulting from choosing to follow up the markers with
      the strongest associations. We show how the results from stage I can
      improve sample size calculations for stage II adaptively. Despite the
      adaptive use of stage I data, the proposed method maintains the nominal
      global type I error for final analyses on the basis of either pure
      replication with the stage II data only or a joint analysis using
      information from both stages. Simulation studies show that sample-size
      calculations accounting for the impact of regression to the mean with the
      bootstrap procedure are more appropriate than is the conventional method.
      We also find that, in the context of flexible design, the joint analysis
      is generally more powerful than the replication analysis.

TI  - Heterogeneity in meta-analyses of genome-wide association investigations.
PG  - e841
AB  - BACKGROUND: Meta-analysis is the systematic and quantitative synthesis of
      effect sizes and the exploration of their diversity across different
      studies. Meta-analyses are increasingly applied to synthesize data from
      genome-wide association (GWA) studies and from other teams that try to
      replicate the genetic variants that emerge from such investigations.
      Between-study heterogeneity is important to document and may point to
      interesting leads. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To exemplify these
      issues, we used data from three GWA studies on type 2 diabetes and their
      replication efforts where meta-analyses of all data using fixed effects
      methods (not incorporating between-study heterogeneity) have already been
      published. We considered 11 polymorphisms that at least one of the three
      teams has suggested as susceptibility loci for type 2 diabetes. The I2
      inconsistency metric (measuring the amount of heterogeneity not due to
      chance) was different from 0 (no detectable heterogeneity) for 6 of the 11
      genetic variants; inconsistency was moderate to very large (I2 = 32-77%)
      for 5 of them. For these 5 polymorphisms, random effects calculations
      incorporating between-study heterogeneity revealed more conservative
      p-values for the summary effects compared with the fixed effects
      calculations. These 5 associations were perused in detail to highlight
      potential explanations for between-study heterogeneity. These include
      identification of a marker for a correlated phenotype (e.g. FTO rs8050136
      being associated with type 2 diabetes through its effect on obesity);
      differential linkage disequilibrium across studies of the identified
      genetic markers with the respective culprit polymorphisms (e.g., possibly
      the case for CDKAL1 polymorphisms or for rs9300039 and markers in linkage
      disequilibrium, as shown by additional studies); and potential bias.
      Results were largely similar, when we treated the discovery and
      replication data from each GWA investigation as separate studies.
      SIGNIFICANCE: Between-study heterogeneity is useful to document in the
      synthesis of data from GWA investigations and can offer valuable insights
      for further clarification of gene-disease associations.
