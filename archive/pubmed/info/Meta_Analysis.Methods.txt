TI  - Statistical heterogeneity in systematic reviews of clinical trials: a
      critical appraisal of guidelines and practice.
PG  - 51-61
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Heterogeneity between study results can be a problem in any
      systematic review or meta-analysis of clinical trials. Identifying its
      presence, investigating its cause and correctly accounting for it in
      analyses all involve difficult decisions for the researcher. Our
      objectives were: to collate recommendations on the subject of dealing with
      heterogeneity in systematic reviews of clinical trials; to investigate
      current practice in addressing heterogeneity in Cochrane reviews; and to
      compare current practice with recommendations. METHODS: We review
      guidelines for those undertaking systematic reviews and examine how
      heterogeneity is addressed in practice in a sample of systematic reviews,
      and their protocols, from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.
      RESULTS: Advice to reviewers is on the whole consistent and sensible.
      However, examination of a sample of Cochrane protocols and reviews
      demonstrates that the advice is difficult to follow given the small
      numbers of studies identified in many systematic reviews, the difficulty
      of pre-specifying important effect modifiers for subgroup analysis or
      meta-regression and the unresolved debate concerning fixed versus random
      effects meta-analyses. There was disagreement between protocols and
      reviews, often either regarding choice of important potential effect
      modifiers or due to the review identifying too few studies to perform
      planned analyses. CONCLUSION: Guidelines that address practical issues are
      required to reduce the risk of spurious findings from investigations of
      heterogeneity. This may involve discouraging statistical investigations
      such as subgroup analyses and meta-regression, rather than simply adopting
      a cautious approach to their interpretation, unless a large number of
      studies is available. The notion of a priori specification of potential
      effect modifiers for a retrospective review of studies is ill-defined, and
      the appropriateness of using a statistical test for heterogeneity to
      decide between analysis strategies is suspect.

TI  - Quantifying heterogeneity in a meta-analysis.
PG  - 1539-58
AB  - The extent of heterogeneity in a meta-analysis partly determines the
      difficulty in drawing overall conclusions. This extent may be measured by
      estimating a between-study variance, but interpretation is then specific
      to a particular treatment effect metric. A test for the existence of
      heterogeneity exists, but depends on the number of studies in the
      meta-analysis. We develop measures of the impact of heterogeneity on a
      meta-analysis, from mathematical criteria, that are independent of the
      number of studies and the treatment effect metric. We derive and propose
      three suitable statistics: H is the square root of the chi2 heterogeneity
      statistic divided by its degrees of freedom; R is the ratio of the
      standard error of the underlying mean from a random effects meta-analysis
      to the standard error of a fixed effect meta-analytic estimate, and I2 is
      a transformation of (H) that describes the proportion of total variation
      in study estimates that is due to heterogeneity. We discuss
      interpretation, interval estimates and other properties of these measures
      and examine them in five example data sets showing different amounts of
      heterogeneity. We conclude that H and I2, which can usually be calculated
      for published meta-analyses, are particularly useful summaries of the
      impact of heterogeneity. One or both should be presented in published
      meta-analyses in preference to the test for heterogeneity.

TI  - How should meta-regression analyses be undertaken and interpreted?
PG  - 1559-73
AB  - Appropriate methods for meta-regression applied to a set of clinical
      trials, and the limitations and pitfalls in interpretation, are
      insufficiently recognized. Here we summarize recent research focusing on
      these issues, and consider three published examples of meta-regression in
      the light of this work. One principal methodological issue is that
      meta-regression should be weighted to take account of both within-trial
      variances of treatment effects and the residual between-trial
      heterogeneity (that is, heterogeneity not explained by the covariates in
      the regression). This corresponds to random effects meta-regression. The
      associations derived from meta-regressions are observational, and have a
      weaker interpretation than the causal relationships derived from
      randomized comparisons. This applies particularly when averages of patient
      characteristics in each trial are used as covariates in the regression.
      Data dredging is the main pitfall in reaching reliable conclusions from
      meta-regression. It can only be avoided by prespecification of covariates
      that will be investigated as potential sources of heterogeneity. However,
      in practice this is not always easy to achieve. The examples considered in
      this paper show the tension between the scientific rationale for using
      meta-regression and the difficult interpretative problems to which such
      analyses are prone.

TI  - Assessing the probability that a positive report is false: an approach for
      molecular epidemiology studies.
PG  - 434-42
AB  - Too many reports of associations between genetic variants and common
      cancer sites and other complex diseases are false positives. A major
      reason for this unfortunate situation is the strategy of declaring
      statistical significance based on a P value alone, particularly, any P
      value below.05. The false positive report probability (FPRP), the
      probability of no true association between a genetic variant and disease
      given a statistically significant finding, depends not only on the
      observed P value but also on both the prior probability that the
      association between the genetic variant and the disease is real and the
      statistical power of the test. In this commentary, we show how to assess
      the FPRP and how to use it to decide whether a finding is deserving of
      attention or "noteworthy." We show how this approach can lead to
      improvements in the design, analysis, and interpretation of molecular
      epidemiology studies. Our proposal can help investigators, editors, and
      readers of research articles to protect themselves from overinterpreting
      statistically significant findings that are not likely to signify a true
      association. An FPRP-based criterion for deciding whether to call a
      finding noteworthy formalizes the process already used informally by
      investigators--that is, tempering enthusiasm for remarkable study findings
      with considerations of plausibility.

      association studies. Published literature databases will be integrated,
      and unpublished data, including 'negative' studies, will be captured by
      online journals and through investigator networks. Systematic reviews will
      be expanded to include more meta-analyses of individual-level data and
      prospective meta-analyses. Field synopses will offer regularly updated
      overviews.

TI  - Assessing heterogeneity in meta-analysis: Q statistic or I2 index?
PG  - 193-206
AB  - In meta-analysis, the usual way of assessing whether a set of single
      studies is homogeneous is by means of the Q test. However, the Q test only
      informs meta-analysts about the presence versus the absence of
      heterogeneity, but it does not report on the extent of such heterogeneity.
      Recently, the I(2) index has been proposed to quantify the degree of
      heterogeneity in a meta-analysis. In this article, the performances of the
      Q test and the confidence interval around the I(2) index are compared by
      means of a Monte Carlo simulation. The results show the utility of the
      I(2) index as a complement to the Q test, although it has the same
      problems of power with a small number of studies.

TI  - The appropriateness of asymmetry tests for publication bias in
      meta-analyses: a large survey.
PG  - 1091-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Statistical tests for funnel-plot asymmetry are common in
      meta-analyses. Inappropriate application can generate misleading
      inferences about publication bias. We aimed to measure, in a survey of
      meta-analyses, how frequently the application of these tests would be not
      meaningful or inappropriate. METHODS: We evaluated all meta-analyses of
      binary outcomes with e 3 studies in the Cochrane Database of Systematic
      Reviews (2003, issue 2). A separate, restricted analysis was confined to
      the largest meta-analysis in each of the review articles. In each
      meta-analysis, we assessed whether criteria to apply asymmetry tests were
      met: no significant heterogeneity, I2 < 50%, e 10 studies (with
      statistically significant results in at least 1) and ratio of the maximal
      to minimal variance across studies > 4. We performed a correlation and 2
      regression asymmetry tests and evaluated their concordance. Finally, we
      sampled 60 meta-analyses from print journals in 2005 that cited use of the
      standard regression test. RESULTS: A total of 366 of 6873 (5%) and 98 of
      846 meta-analyses (12%) in the wider and restricted Cochrane data set,
      respectively, would have qualified for use of asymmetry tests. Asymmetry
      test results were significant in 7%-18% of the meta-analyses. Concordance
      between the 3 tests was modest (estimated k 0.33-0.66). Of the 60 journal
      meta-analyses, 7 (12%) would qualify for asymmetry tests; all 11 claims
      for identification of publication bias were made in the face of large and
      significant heterogeneity. INTERPRETATION: Statistical conditions for
      employing asymmetry tests for publication bias are absent from most
      meta-analyses; yet, in medical journals these tests are performed often
      and interpreted erroneously.
