AB  - BACKGROUND: Risk for complex disease is thought to be controlled by
      multiple genetic risk factors, each with small individual effects.
      Meta-analyses of several independent studies may be helpful to increase
      the ability to detect association when effect sizes are modest. Although
      many software options are available for meta-analysis of genetic
      case-control data, no currently available software implements the method
      described by Kazeem and Farrall (2005), which combines data from
      independent family-based and case-control studies. RESULTS: I introduce
      the package catmap for the R statistical computing environment that
      implements fixed- and random-effects pooled estimates for case-control and
      transmission disequilibrium methods, allowing for the use of genetic
      association data across study types. In addition, catmap may be used to
      create forest and funnel plots and to perform sensitivity analysis and
      cumulative meta-analysis. catmap is available from the Comprehensive R
      Archive Network http://www.r-project.org. CONCLUSION: catmap allows
      researchers to synthesize data to assess evidence for association in
      studies of genetic polymorphisms, facilitating the use of pooled data
      analyses which may increase power to detect moderate genetic associations.
