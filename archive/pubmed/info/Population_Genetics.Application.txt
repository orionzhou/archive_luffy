TI  - Autosomal, mitochondrial, and Y chromosome DNA variation in Finland:
      evidence for a male-specific bottleneck.
PG  - 381-99
AB  - The high prevalence of rare genetic diseases in Finland has been
      attributed to a founder effect some 2,000 years ago. However, this
      hypothesis has not been supported from mtDNA sequence and autosomal
      microsatellite data which indicate high levels of gene diversity. Here we
      have identified genetic evidence for a population bottleneck by examining
      variable microsatellite loci on the nonrecombining portion of Y
      chromosomes from Finland and four populations from Europe and the
      Americas. Sequence data from segment I of the control region (HVS-1) of
      mtDNA (360 bases) and 20 autosomal dinucleotide repeat markers were also
      analyzed. Partitions of genetic variance within and between populations
      revealed significant levels of Y-chromosome differentiation between
      populations. Phylogenetic and diversity analyses revealed divergent
      Finnish Y-haplotype clades and significantly lower Y-haplotype diversity
      among Finns as compared to other populations. Surprisingly, Finnish
      Y-haplotype diversity was even lower than the Native American populations.
      These results provide support for the Finnish bottleneck hypothesis.
      Evidence for two separate founding Finnish Y-chromosome lineages was also
      observed from the Y-chromosome phylogeny. A limited number of closely
      related founding males may have contributed to the low number of paternal
      lineages in the Finnish population. In contrast, high levels of genetic
      diversity for mtDNA and autosomal STRs may be the result of sex-biased
      gene flow and recent immigration to urban areas from established internal
      isolates within Finland.

TI  - The distribution of human genetic diversity: a comparison of
      mitochondrial, autosomal, and Y-chromosome data.
PG  - 979-88
AB  - We report a comparison of worldwide genetic variation among 255
      individuals by using autosomal, mitochondrial, and Y-chromosome
      polymorphisms. Variation is assessed by use of 30 autosomal
      restriction-site polymorphisms (RSPs), 60 autosomal short-tandem-repeat
      polymorphisms (STRPs), 13 Alu-insertion polymorphisms and one LINE-1
      element, 611 bp of mitochondrial control-region sequence, and 10
      Y-chromosome polymorphisms. Analysis of these data reveals substantial
      congruity among this diverse array of genetic systems. With the exception
      of the autosomal RSPs, in which an ascertainment bias exists, all systems
      show greater gene diversity in Africans than in either Europeans or
      Asians. Africans also have the largest total number of alleles, as well as
      the largest number of unique alleles, for most systems. GST values are
      11%-18% for the autosomal systems and are two to three times higher for
      the mtDNA sequence and Y-chromosome RSPs. This difference is expected
      because of the lower effective population size of mtDNA and Y chromosomes.
      A lower value is seen for Y-chromosome STRs, reflecting a relative lack of
      continental population structure, as a result of rapid mutation and
      genetic drift. Africa has higher GST values than does either Europe or
      Asia for all systems except the Y-chromosome STRs and Alus. All systems
      except the Y-chromosome STRs show less variation between populations
      within continents than between continents. These results are reassuring in
      their consistency and offer broad support for an African origin of modern
      human populations.

TI  - The Y chromosome pool of Jews as part of the genetic landscape of the
      Middle East.
PG  - 1095-112
AB  - A sample of 526 Y chromosomes representing six Middle Eastern populations
      (Ashkenazi, Sephardic, and Kurdish Jews from Israel; Muslim Kurds; Muslim
      Arabs from Israel and the Palestinian Authority Area; and Bedouin from the
      Negev) was analyzed for 13 binary polymorphisms and six microsatellite
      loci. The investigation of the genetic relationship among three Jewish
      communities revealed that Kurdish and Sephardic Jews were
      indistinguishable from one another, whereas both differed slightly, yet
      significantly, from Ashkenazi Jews. The differences among Ashkenazim may
      be a result of low-level gene flow from European populations and/or
      genetic drift during isolation. Admixture between Kurdish Jews and their
      former Muslim host population in Kurdistan appeared to be negligible. In
      comparison with data available from other relevant populations in the
      region, Jews were found to be more closely related to groups in the north
      of the Fertile Crescent (Kurds, Turks, and Armenians) than to their Arab
      neighbors. The two haplogroups Eu 9 and Eu 10 constitute a major part of
      the Y chromosome pool in the analyzed sample. Our data suggest that Eu 9
      originated in the northern part, and Eu 10 in the southern part of the
      Fertile Crescent. Genetic dating yielded estimates of the expansion of
      both haplogroups that cover the Neolithic period in the region.
      Palestinian Arabs and Bedouin differed from the other Middle Eastern
      populations studied here, mainly in specific high-frequency Eu 10
      haplotypes not found in the non-Arab groups. These chromosomes might have
      been introduced through migrations from the Arabian Peninsula during the
      last two millennia. The present study contributes to the elucidation of
      the complex demographic history that shaped the present-day genetic
      landscape in the region.

TI  - Population genetic structure of variable drug response.
PG  - 265-9
AB  - Geographic patterns of genetic variation, including variation at drug
      metabolizing enzyme (DME) loci and drug targets, indicate that geographic
      structuring of inter-individual variation in drug response may occur
      frequently. This raises two questions: how to represent human population
      genetic structure in the evaluation of drug safety and efficacy, and how
      to relate this structure to drug response. We address these by (i)
      inferring the genetic structure present in a heterogeneous sample and (ii)
      comparing the distribution of DME variants across the inferred genetic
      clusters of individuals. We find that commonly used ethnic labels are both
      insufficient and inaccurate representations of the inferred genetic
      clusters, and that drug-metabolizing profiles, defined by the distribution
      of DME variants, differ significantly among the clusters. We note,
      however, that the complexity of human demographic history means that there
      is no obvious natural clustering scheme, nor an obvious appropriate degree
      of resolution. Our comparison of drug-metabolizing profiles across the
      inferred clusters establishes a framework for assessing the appropriate
      level of resolution in relating genetic structure to drug response.

TI  - Nucleotide diversity and haplotype structure of the human angiotensinogen
      gene in two populations.
PG  - 108-23
AB  - Variation in the angiotensinogen gene, AGT, has been associated with
      variation in plasma angiotensinogen levels. In addition, the T235M
      polymorphism in the AGT product is associated with an increased risk of
      essential hypertension in multiple populations, making AGT a good example
      of a quantitative-trait locus underlying susceptibility to a common
      disease. To better understand genetic variation in AGT, we sequenced a
      14.4-kb genomic region spanning the entire AGT and identified 44
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Forty-two SNPs were observed both
      in 88 white and in 77 Japanese unselected subjects. Six major haplotypes
      accounted for most of the variation in this region, indicating less
      allelic complexity than in many other genomic regions. Although the two
      populations were found to share all of the major AGT haplotypes, there
      were substantial differences in haplotype frequencies. Pairwise linkage
      disequilibrium (LD), measured by the D', r(2), and d(2) statistics,
      demonstrated a general pattern of decline with increasing distance, but,
      as expected in a small genomic region, individual LD values were highly
      variable. LD between T235M and each of the other 39 SNPs was assessed in
      order to model the usefulness of LD to detect a disease-associated
      mutation. Among the Japanese subjects, 13 (33%) of the SNPs had r(2)
      values >0.1, whereas this statistic was substantially higher for the white
      subjects (occurring in 35/39 [90%]). LD between a hypertension-associated
      promoter mutation, A-6G, and 39 SNPs was also measured. Similar results
      were obtained, with 33% of the SNPs showing r(2)>0.1 in the Japanese
      subjects and 92% of the SNPs showing r(2)>0.1 in the white subjects. This
      difference, which occurs despite an overall similarity in LD patterns in
      the two populations, reflects a much higher frequency of the
      M235-associated haplotype in the white sample. These results have
      important implications for the usefulness of LD approaches in the mapping
      of genes underlying susceptibility to complex diseases.

TI  - Native American Y chromosomes in Polynesia: the genetic impact of the
      Polynesian slave trade.
PG  - 1282-7
AB  - Since Thor Heyerdahl asserted that Polynesia was first colonized from the
      Americas (Heyerdahl 1950), geneticists have sought--but have not
      found--any evidence to support his theories. Here, Native American Y
      chromosomes are detected on the Polynesian island of Rapa. However, this,
      together with other odd features of the island's Y-chromosomal gene pool,
      is best explained as the genetic impact of a 19th century Peruvian slave
      trade in Polynesia. These findings underscore the need to account for
      history before turning to prehistory and the value of archival research to
      understanding modern genetic diversity. Although the impact of the
      Atlantic slave trade on the distribution of modern genetic diversity has
      been well appreciated, this represents the first study investigating the
      impact of this underappreciated episode on genetic diversity in the
      Pacific.

TI  - Genetic origins of the Ainu inferred from combined DNA analyses of
      maternal and paternal lineages.
PG  - 187-93
AB  - The Ainu, a minority ethnic group from the northernmost island of Japan,
      was investigated for DNA polymorphisms both from maternal (mitochondrial
      DNA) and paternal (Y chromosome) lineages extensively. Other Asian
      populations inhabiting North, East, and Southeast Asia were also examined
      for detailed phylogeographic analyses at the mtDNA sequence type as well
      as Y-haplogroup levels. The maternal and paternal gene pools of the Ainu
      contained 25 mtDNA sequence types and three Y-haplogroups, respectively.
      Eleven of the 25 mtDNA sequence types were unique to the Ainu and
      accounted for over 50% of the population, whereas 14 were widely
      distributed among other Asian populations. Of the 14 shared types, the
      most frequently shared type was found in common among the Ainu, Nivkhi in
      northern Sakhalin, and Koryaks in the Kamchatka Peninsula. Moreover,
      analysis of genetic distances calculated from the mtDNA data revealed that
      the Ainu seemed to be related to both the Nivkhi and other Japanese
      populations (such as mainland Japanese and Okinawans) at the population
      level. On the paternal side, the vast majority (87.5%) of the Ainu
      exhibited the Asian-specific YAP+ lineages (Y-haplogroups D-M55* and
      D-M125), which were distributed only in the Japanese Archipelago in this
      analysis. On the other hand, the Ainu exhibited no other Y-haplogroups
      (C-M8, O-M175*, and O-M122*) common in mainland Japanese and Okinawans. It
      is noteworthy that the rest of the Ainu gene pool was occupied by the
      paternal lineage (Y-haplogroup C-M217*) from North Asia including
      Sakhalin. Thus, the present findings suggest that the Ainu retain a
      certain degree of their own genetic uniqueness, while having higher
      genetic affinities with other regional populations in Japan and the Nivkhi
      among Asian populations.

PG  - 408-19
AB  - The prehistoric peopling of East Asia by modern humans remains
      controversial with respect to early population migrations. Here, we
      present a systematic sampling and genetic screening of an East
      Asian-specific Y-chromosome haplogroup (O3-M122) in 2,332 individuals from
      diverse East Asian populations. Our results indicate that the O3-M122
      lineage is dominant in East Asian populations, with an average frequency
      of 44.3%. The microsatellite data show that the O3-M122 haplotypes in
      southern East Asia are more diverse than those in northern East Asia,
      suggesting a southern origin of the O3-M122 mutation. It was estimated
      that the early northward migration of the O3-M122 lineages in East Asia
      occurred approximately 25,000-30,000 years ago, consistent with the fossil
      records of modern humans in East Asia.

TI  - Melanesian and Asian origins of Polynesians: mtDNA and Y chromosome
      gradients across the Pacific.
PG  - 2234-44
AB  - The human settlement of the Pacific Islands represents one of the most
      recent major migration events of mankind. Polynesians originated in Asia
      according to linguistic evidence or in Melanesia according to
      archaeological evidence. To shed light on the genetic origins of
      Polynesians, we investigated over 400 Polynesians from 8 island groups, in
      comparison with over 900 individuals from potential parental populations
      of Melanesia, Southeast and East Asia, and Australia, by means of Y
      chromosome (NRY) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) markers. Overall, we
      classified 94.1% of Polynesian Y chromosomes and 99.8% of Polynesian
      mtDNAs as of either Melanesian (NRY-DNA: 65.8%, mtDNA: 6%) or Asian
      (NRY-DNA: 28.3%, mtDNA: 93.8%) origin, suggesting a dual genetic origin of
      Polynesians in agreement with the "Slow Boat" hypothesis. Our data suggest
      a pronounced admixture bias in Polynesians toward more Melanesian men than
      women, perhaps as a result of matrilocal residence in the ancestral
      Polynesian society. Although dating methods are consistent with somewhat
      similar entries of NRY/mtDNA haplogroups into Polynesia, haplotype sharing
      suggests an earlier appearance of Melanesian haplogroups than those from
      Asia. Surprisingly, we identified gradients in the frequency distribution
      of some NRY/mtDNA haplogroups across Polynesia and a gradual west-to-east
      decrease of overall NRY/mtDNA diversity, not only providing evidence for a
      west-to-east direction of Polynesian settlements but also suggesting that
      Pacific voyaging was regular rather than haphazard. We also demonstrate
      that Fiji played a pivotal role in the history of Polynesia: humans
      probably first migrated to Fiji, and subsequent settlement of Polynesia
      probably came from Fiji.

TI  - Genetic analysis of three US population groups using an X-chromosomal STR
      decaplex.
PG  - 198-203
AB  - An X-chromosomal multiplex amplifying ten short tandem repeats (STRs) in
      one single PCR reaction was developed and optimized in this work. The
      X-STRs included were DXS8378, DXS9898, DXS8377, HPRTB, GATA172D05,
      DXS7423, DXS6809, DXS7132, DXS101, and DXS6789. Decaplex performance was
      tested on 377 male samples from three United States population groups,
      namely, 130 African Americans, 104 Asians, and 143 Hispanics. DXS8377 was
      the most polymorphic locus across all three populations, whereas DXS7423
      was the least informative marker. Genetic distance analysis (R (ST) and F
      (ST)) performed for the three populations residing in New York showed
      significant genetic distances between population groups for most pairwise
      comparisons, except for HPRTB, DXS6809, and DXS7132. When testing linkage
      disequilibrium for all pairs of loci in the three groups, no significant
      association was found between any pair of the loci studied, after applying
      Bonferroni correction. The high values for the average probability of
      excluding a random man obtained in all three populations when both mother
      and daughter are tested or when father/daughter relationships are
      evaluated support the potential of this decaplex system in kinship
      analysis. Also, the overall high power of discrimination values for
      samples of female and male origin, confirms the usefulness of this
      decaplex system in identification analysis. As expected, results also
      support the use of independent databases comprising these ten X-linked
      loci for the three US populations evaluated.

TI  - Y-STR variation among Slavs: evidence for the Slavic homeland in the
      middle Dnieper basin.
PG  - 406-14
AB  - A set of 18 Y-chromosomal microsatellite loci was analysed in 568 males
      from Poland, Slovakia and three regions of Belarus. The results were
      compared to data available for 2,937 Y chromosome samples from 20 other
      Slavic populations. Lack of relationship between linguistic, geographic
      and historical relations between Slavic populations and Y-short tandem
      repeat (STR) haplotype distribution was observed. Two genetically distant
      groups of Slavic populations were revealed: one encompassing all
      Western-Slavic, Eastern-Slavic, and two Southern-Slavic populations, and
      one encompassing all remaining Southern Slavs. An analysis of molecular
      variance (AMOVA) based on Y-chromosomal STRs showed that the variation
      observed between the two population groups was 4.3%, and was higher than
      the level of genetic variance among populations within the groups (1.2%).
      Homogeneity of northern Slavic paternal lineages in Europe was shown to
      stretch from the Alps to the upper Volga and involve ethnicities speaking
      completely different branches of Slavic languages. The central position of
      the population of Ukraine in the network of insignificant AMOVA
      comparisons, and the lack of traces of significant contribution of ancient
      tribes inhabiting present-day Poland to the gene pool of Eastern and
      Southern Slavs, support hypothesis placing the earliest known homeland of
      Slavs in the middle Dnieper basin.

TI  - Y-chromosome evidence suggests a common paternal heritage of
      Austro-Asiatic populations.
PG  - 47
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Austro-Asiatic linguistic family, which is considered to
      be the oldest of all the families in India, has a substantial presence in
      Southeast Asia. However, the possibility of any genetic link among the
      linguistic sub-families of the Indian Austro-Asiatics on the one hand and
      between the Indian and the Southeast Asian Austro-Asiatics on the other
      has not been explored till now. Therefore, to trace the origin and
      historic expansion of Austro-Asiatic groups of India, we analysed
      Y-chromosome SNP and STR data of the 1222 individuals from 25 Indian
      populations, covering all the three branches of Austro-Asiatic tribes,
      viz. Mundari, Khasi-Khmuic and Mon-Khmer, along with the previously
      published data on 214 relevant populations from Asia and Oceania. RESULTS:
      Our results suggest a strong paternal genetic link, not only among the
      subgroups of Indian Austro-Asiatic populations but also with those of
      Southeast Asia. However, maternal link based on mtDNA is not evident. The
      results also indicate that the haplogroup O-M95 had originated in the
      Indian Austro-Asiatic populations ~65,000 yrs BP (95% C.I. 25,442-132,230)
      and their ancestors carried it further to Southeast Asia via the Northeast
      Indian corridor. Subsequently, in the process of expansion, the Mon-Khmer
      populations from Southeast Asia seem to have migrated and colonized
      Andaman and Nicobar Islands at a much later point of time. CONCLUSION: Our
      findings are consistent with the linguistic evidence, which suggests that
      the linguistic ancestors of the Austro-Asiatic populations have originated
      in India and then migrated to Southeast Asia.

TI  - Allelic variation in the NPY gene in 14 Indian populations.
PG  - 592-8
AB  - NPY is a 36-aminoacid peptide expressed in several areas of the nervous
      system. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) receptors represent a widely diffused system
      that is involved in the regulation of multiple biological functions. The
      human NPY gene is located in chromosome 7. The functional significance of
      coding Leu7Pro polymorphism in the signal peptide of preproNPY is known.
      Six hundred and fifty four individuals of 14 ethnic Indian populations
      were screened for three mutations in the NPY gene, including Leu7Pro. We
      found that the Pro7 frequencies among the studied populations were much
      higher than in previous studies from other parts of the world. The highest
      allele frequency of Pro7 was detected in the Kota population in the
      Nilgiri Hill region of south India, and this may reflect a founder event
      in the past or genetic drift. All populations followed the Hardy-Weinberg
      equilibrium for the assayed markers. A total of five haplotypes were
      observed, only two of which were found to occur with a high frequency in
      all populations. No linkage disequilibrium (LD) was observed across the
      tested alleles in any population with the exception of Leu7Pro and
      Ser50Ser in the Badaga population (chi(2) = 13.969; p = 0.0001).

TI  - A comprehensive analysis of microsatellite diversity in Aboriginal
      Australians.
PG  - 712-28
AB  - Indigenous Australians have a unique evolutionary history that has
      resulted in a complex system of inter and intra-tribal relationships.
      While a number of studies have examined the population genetics of
      indigenous Australians, most have used a single sample to illuminate
      details of the global dispersal of modern humans and few studies have
      focussed on the population genetic features of the widely dispersed
      communities of the indigenous population. In this study we examine the
      largest Aboriginal Australian sample yet analysed (N = 8,868) at fifteen
      hypervariable autosomal microsatellite loci. A comprehensive analysis of
      differentiation indicates different levels of heterogeneity among
      indigenous peoples from traditional regions of Aboriginal Australia. The
      most genetically differentiated populations inhabit the North of the
      country, in particular the Tiwi of Melville and Bathurst islands, Arnhem
      Land (itself divided into West and East Arnhem), and Fitzmaurice regions.
      These tribal groups are most differentiated from other Aboriginal
      Australian tribes, especially those of the Central Desert regions, and
      also show marked heterogeneity from one another. These genetic findings
      are supportive of observations of body measurements, skin colour, and
      dermatoglyphic features which also vary substantially between tribes of
      the North (e.g. Arnhem Land) and Central Australian regions and, more
      specifically, between the Tiwi and West and East Arnhem tribes. This study
      provides the most comprehensive survey of the population genetics of
      Aboriginal Australia.

TI  - Drift, admixture, and selection in human evolution: a study with DNA
      polymorphisms.
PG  - 839-43
AB  - Accuracy of evolutionary analysis of populations within a species requires
      the testing of a large number of genetic polymorphisms belonging to many
      loci. We report here a reconstruction of human differentiation based on
      100 DNA polymorphisms tested in five populations from four continents. The
      results agree with earlier conclusions based on other classes of genetic
      markers but reveal that Europeans do not fit a simple model of
      independently evolving populations with equal evolutionary rates.
      Evolutionary models involving early admixture are compatible with the
      data. Taking one such model into account, we examined through simulation
      whether random genetic drift alone might explain the variation among gene
      frequencies across populations and genes. A measure of variation among
      populations was calculated for each polymorphism, and its distribution for
      the 100 polymorphisms was compared with that expected for a drift-only
      hypothesis. At least two-thirds of the polymorphisms appear to be
      selectively neutral, but there are significant deviations at the two ends
      of the observed distribution of the measure of variation: a slight excess
      of polymorphisms with low variation and a greater excess with high
      variation. This indicates that a few DNA polymorphisms are affected by
      natural selection, rarely heterotic, and more often disruptive, while most
      are selectively neutral.

TI  - Improved analyses of human mtDNA sequences support a recent African origin
      for Homo sapiens.
PG  - 863-82
AB  - New quantitative methods are applied to the 135 human mitochondrial
      sequences from the Vigilant et al. data set. General problems in analyzing
      large numbers of short sequences are discussed, and an improved strategy
      is suggested. A key feature is to focus not on individual trees but on the
      general "landscape" of trees. Over 1,000 searches were made from random
      starting trees with only one tree (a local optimum) being retained each
      time, thereby ensuring optima were found independently. A new tree
      comparison metric was developed that is unaffected by rearrangements of
      trees around many very short internal edges. Use of this metric showed
      that downweighting hypervariable sites revealed more evolutionary
      structure than studies that weighted all sites equally. Our results are
      consistent with convergence toward a global optimum. Crucial features are
      that the best optima show very strong regional differentiation, a common
      group of 49 African sequences is found in all the best optima, and the
      best optima contain the 16 !Kung sequences in a separate group of San
      people. The other 86 sequences form a heterogeneous mixture of Africans,
      Europeans, Australopapuans, and Asians. Thus all major human lineages
      occur in Africa, but only a subset occurs in the rest of the world. The
      existence of these African-only groups strongly contradicts multiregional
      theories for the origin of Homo sapiens that require widespread migration
      and interbreeding over the entire range of H. erectus. Only when the
      multiregional model is rejected is it appropriate to consider the root,
      based on a single locus, to be the center of origin of a population
      (otherwise different loci could give alternative geographic positions for
      the root). For this data, several methods locate the root within the group
      of 49 African sequences and are thus consistent with the recent African
      origin of H. sapiens. We demonstrate that the time of the last common
      ancestor cannot be the time of major expansion in human numbers, and our
      results are thus also consistent with recent models that differentiate
      between the last common ancestor, expansion out of Africa, and the major
      expansion in human populations. Such a two-phase model is consistent with
      a wide range of molecular and archeological evidence.

TI  - Origins and affinities of modern humans: a comparison of mitochondrial and
      nuclear genetic data.
PG  - 523-38
AB  - To test hypotheses about the origin of modern humans, we analyzed mtDNA
      sequences, 30 nuclear restriction-site polymorphisms (RSPs), and 30
      tetranucleotide short tandem repeat (STR) polymorphisms in 243 Africans,
      Asians, and Europeans. An evolutionary tree based on mtDNA displays deep
      African branches, indicating greater genetic diversity for African
      populations. This finding, which is consistent with previous mtDNA
      analyses, has been interpreted as evidence for an African origin of modern
      humans. Both sets of nuclear polymorphisms, as well as a third set of
      trinucleotide polymorphisms, are highly consistent with one another but
      fail to show deep branches for African populations. These results, which
      represent the first direct comparison of mtDNA and nuclear genetic data in
      major continental populations, undermine the genetic evidence for an
      African origin of modern humans.

TI  - Paternal and maternal DNA lineages reveal a bottleneck in the founding of
      the Finnish population.
PG  - 12035-9
AB  - An analysis of Y-chromosomal haplotypes in several European populations
      reveals an almost monomorphic pattern in the Finns, whereas Y-chromosomal
      diversity is significantly higher in other populations. Furthermore,
      analyses of nucleotide positions in the mitochondrial control region that
      evolve slowly show a decrease in genetic diversity in Finns. Thus,
      relatively few men and women have contributed the genetic lineages that
      today survive in the Finnish population. This is likely to have caused the
      so-called "Finnish disease heritage"-i.e., the occurrence of several
      genetic diseases in the Finnish population that are rare elsewhere. A
      preliminary analysis of the mitochondrial mutations that have accumulated
      subsequent to the bottleneck suggests that it occurred about 4000 years
      ago, presumably when populations using agriculture and animal husbandry
      arrived in Finland.

TI  - Genetic structure of the ancestral population of modern humans.
PG  - 146-55
AB  - Neutral DNA polymorphisms from an 8-kb segment of the dystrophin gene,
      previously ascertained in a worldwide sample (n = 250 chromosomes), were
      used to characterize the population ancestral to the present-day human
      groups. The ancestral state of each polymorphic site was determined by
      comparing human variants with their orthologous sites in the great apes.
      The "age before fixation" of the underlying mutations was estimated from
      the frequencies of the new alleles and analyzed in the context of these
      polymorphisms' distribution among 13 populations from Africa, Europe,
      Asia, New Guinea, and the Americas (n = 860 chromosomes in total).
      Seventeen polymorphisms older tan 100,000-200,000 years, which contributed
      approximately 90% to the overall nucleotide diversity, were common to all
      human groups. Polymorphisms endemic to human groups or continentally
      restricted were younger than 100,000-200,000 years. Africans (six
      populations) with 13 such sites stood out from the rest of the world
      (seven populations), where only 2 population-specific variants were
      observed. The similarity of the frequencies of the old polymorphisms in
      Africans and non-Africans suggested a similar profile of genetic
      variability in the population before the modern human's divergence. This
      ancestral population was characterized by an effective size of about
      10,000 as estimated from the nucleotide diversity; this size may describe
      the number of breeding individuals over a long time during the Middle
      Pleistocene or reflect a speciation bottleneck from an initially larger
      population at the end of this period.

TI  - Genetic evidence for a higher female migration rate in humans.
PG  - 278-80
AB  - Mitochondrial DNA and the Y chromosome have been used extensively in the
      study of modern human origins and other phylogenetic questions, but not in
      the context of their sex-specific modes of transmission. mtDNA is
      transmitted exclusively by females, whereas the Y chromosome is passed
      only among males. As a result, differences in the reproductive output or
      migration rate of males and females will influence the geographic patterns
      and relative level of genetic diversity on the Y chromosome, autosomes and
      mtDNA (ref. 1). We have found that Y chromosome variants tend to be more
      localized geographically than those of mtDNA and the autosomes. The
      fraction of variation within human populations for Y chromosome single
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) is 35.5%, versus 80-85% for the autosomes
      and mtDNA (refs 6-8). A higher female than male migration rate (via
      patrilocality, the tendency for a wife to move into her husband's natal
      household) explains most of this discrepancy, because diverse Y
      chromosomes would enter a population at a lower rate than mtDNA or the
      autosomes. Polygyny may also contribute, but the reduction of variation
      within populations that we measure for the Y chromosome, relative to the
      autosomes and mitochondrial DNA, is of such magnitude that differences in
      the effective population sizes of the sexes alone are insufficient to
      produce the observation.
