TI  - X chromosome evidence for ancient human histories.
PG  - 3320-4
AB  - Diverse African and non-African samples of the X-linked PDHA1 (pyruvate
      dehydrogenase E1 alpha subunit) locus revealed a fixed DNA sequence
      difference between the two sample groups. The age of onset of population
      subdivision appears to be about 200 thousand years ago. This predates the
      earliest modern human fossils, suggesting the transformation to modern
      humans occurred in a subdivided population. The base of the PDHA1 gene
      tree is relatively ancient, with an estimated age of 1.86 million years, a
      late Pliocene time associated with early species of Homo. PDHA1 revealed
      very low variation among non-Africans, but in other respects the data are
      consistent with reports from other X-linked and autosomal haplotype data
      sets. Like these other genes, but in conflict with microsatellite and
      mitochondrial data, PDHA1 does not show evidence of human population
      expansion.

TI  - Population bottlenecks and Pleistocene human evolution.
PG  - 2-22
AB  - We review the anatomical and archaeological evidence for an early
      population bottleneck in humans and bracket the time when it could have
      occurred. We outline the subsequent demographic changes that the
      archaeological evidence of range expansions and contractions address, and
      we examine how inbreeding effective population size provides an
      alternative view of past population size change. This addresses the
      question of other, more recent, population size bottlenecks, and we review
      nonrecombining and recombining genetic systems that may reflect them. We
      examine how these genetic data constrain the possibility of significant
      population size bottlenecks (i.e., of sufficiently small size and/or long
      duration to minimize genetic variation in autosomal and haploid systems)
      at several different critical times in human history. Different
      constraints appear in nonrecombining and recombining systems, and among
      the autosomal loci most are incompatible with any Pleistocene population
      size expansions. Microsatellite data seem to show Pleistocene population
      size expansions, but in aggregate they are difficult to interpret because
      different microsatellite studies do not show the same expansion. The
      archaeological data are only compatible with a few of these analyses, most
      prominently with data from Alu elements, and we use these facts to
      question whether the view of the past from analysis of inbreeding
      effective population size is valid. Finally, we examine the issue of
      whether inbreeding effective population size provides any reasonable
      measure of the actual past size of the human species. We contend that if
      the evidence of a population size bottleneck early in the evolution of our
      lineage is accepted, most genetic data either lack the resolution to
      address subsequent changes in the human population or do not meet the
      assumptions required to do so validly. It is our conclusion that, at the
      moment, genetic data cannot disprove a simple model of exponential
      population growth following a bottleneck 2 MYA at the origin of our
      lineage and extending through the Pleistocene. Archaeological and
      paleontological data indicate that this model is too oversimplified to be
      an accurate reflection of detailed population history, and therefore we
      find that genetic data lack the resolution to validly reflect many details
      of Pleistocene human population change. However, there is one detail that
      these data are sufficient to address. Both genetic and anthropological
      data are incompatible with the hypothesis of a recent population size
      bottleneck. Such an event would be expected to leave a significant mark
      across numerous genetic loci and observable anatomical traits, but while
      some subsets of data are compatible with a recent population size
      bottleneck, there is no consistently expressed effect that can be found
      across the range where it should appear, and this absence disproves the
      hypothesis.

TI  - Ancient DNA in anthropology: methods, applications, and ethics.
PG  - 92-130
AB  - Anthropologists were quick to recognize the potential of new techniques in
      molecular biology to provide additional lines of evidence on questions
      long investigated in anthropology, as well as those questions that, while
      always of interest, could not have been addressed by more traditional
      techniques. The earliest ancient DNA studies, both within anthropology and
      in other fields, lacked rigorous hypothesis testing. However, more
      recently the true value of ancient DNA studies is being realized, and
      methods are being applied to a wide variety of anthropological questions.
      We review the most common methods and applications to date, and describe
      promising avenues of future research. We find that ancient DNA analyses
      have a valuable place in the array of anthropological techniques, but
      argue that such studies must not be undertaken merely to demonstrate that
      surviving DNA is present in organic remains, and that no such work should
      be performed before a careful consideration of the possible ethical
      ramifications of the research is undertaken.

TI  - Population growth makes waves in the distribution of pairwise genetic
      differences.
PG  - 552-69
AB  - Episodes of population growth and decline leave characteristic signatures
      in the distribution of nucleotide (or restriction) site differences
      between pairs of individuals. These signatures appear in histograms
      showing the relative frequencies of pairs of individuals who differ by i
      sites, where i = 0, 1, .... In this distribution an episode of growth
      generates a wave that travels to the right, traversing 1 unit of the
      horizontal axis in each 1/2u generations, where u is the mutation rate.
      The smaller the initial population, the steeper will be the leading face
      of the wave. The larger the increase in population size, the smaller will
      be the distribution's vertical intercept. The implications of continued
      exponential growth are indistinguishable from those of a sudden burst of
      population growth Bottlenecks in population size also generate waves
      similar to those produced by a sudden expansion, but with elevated
      uppertail probabilities. Reductions in population size initially generate
      L-shaped distributions with high probability of identity, but these
      converge rapidly to a new equilibrium. In equilibrium populations the
      theoretical curves are free of waves. However, computer simulations of
      such populations generate empirical distributions with many peaks and
      little resemblance to the theory. On the other hand, agreement is better
      in the transient (nonequilibrium) case, where simulated empirical
      distributions typically exhibit waves very similar to those predicted by
      theory. Thus, waves in empirical distributions may be rich in information
      about the history of population dynamics.

TI  - Recent developments in genetic data analysis: what can they tell us about
      human demographic history?
PG  - 365-79
AB  - Over the last decade, a number of new methods of population genetic
      analysis based on likelihood have been introduced. This review describes
      and explains the general statistical techniques that have recently been
      used, and discusses the underlying population genetic models. Experimental
      papers that use these methods to infer human demographic and
      phylogeographic history are reviewed. It appears that the use of
      likelihood has hitherto had little impact in the field of human population
      genetics, which is still primarily driven by more traditional approaches.
      However, with the current uncertainty about the effects of natural
      selection, population structure and ascertainment of single-nucleotide
      polymorphism markers, it is suggested that likelihood-based methods may
      have a greater impact in the future.

TI  - Genetic absolute dating based on microsatellites and the origin of modern
      humans.
PG  - 6723-7
AB  - We introduce a new genetic distance for microsatellite loci, incorporating
      features of the stepwise mutation model, and test its performance on
      microsatellite polymorphisms in humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas. We find
      that it performs well in determining the relations among the primates, but
      less well than other distance measures (not based on the stepwise mutation
      model) in determining the relations among closely related human
      populations. However, the deepest split in the human phylogeny seems to be
      accurately reconstructed by the new distance and separates African and
      non-African populations. The new distance is independent of population
      size and therefore allows direct estimation of divergence times if the
      mutation rate is known. Based on 30 microsatellite polymorphisms and a
      recently reported average mutation rate of 5.6 x 10(-4) at 15 dinucleotide
      microsatellites, we estimate that the deepest split in the human phylogeny
      occurred about 156,000 years ago. Unlike most previous estimates, ours
      requires no external calibration of the rate of molecular evolution. We
      can use such calibrations, however, to test our estimate.

TI  - Mutational processes of simple-sequence repeat loci in human populations.
PG  - 3166-70
AB  - Mutational processes of simple sequence repeats (SSRs) in complex genomes
      are poorly understood. We examined these processes by introducing a
      two-phase mutation model. In this model, most mutations are single-step
      changes, but infrequent large jumps in repeat number also occur. We used
      computer simulations to determine expected values of statistics that
      reflect frequency distributions of allele size for the two-phase model and
      two alternatives, the one-step and geometric models. The theoretical
      expectations for each model were tested by comparison with observed values
      for 10 SSR loci genotyped in the Sardinian population, whose genetic and
      demographic histories have been previously reconstructed. The two-phase
      model provided the best fit to the data for most of these loci in this
      population. In the analysis we assumed that the loci were neutral and that
      this population had undergone rapid population growth. Recent observations
      made for unstable trinucleotide repeats support our suggestion that
      frequent small changes and rare large changes in repeat number represent
      two distinct classes of mutation at SSR loci. We genotyped the same 10
      loci in Egyptian and sub-Saharan African samples to assess the utility of
      SSRs for studying the divergence of populations and found that estimates
      of interpopulation distances from SSRs were similar to those derived from
      analysis of mitochondrial DNA.

AB  - We summarize available data on the frequencies of alleles at
      microsatellite loci in human populations and compare observed
      distributions of allele frequencies to those generated by a simulation of
      the stepwise mutation model. We show that observed frequency distributions
      at 108 loci are consistent with the results of the model under the
      assumption that mutations cause an increase or decrease in repeat number
      by one and under the condition that the product Nu, where N is the
      effective population size and u is the mutation rate, is larger than one.
      We show that the variance of the distribution of allele sizes is a useful
      estimator of Nu and performs much better than previously suggested
      estimators for the stepwise mutation model. In the data, there is no
      correlation between the mean and variance in allele size at a locus or
      between the number of alleles and mean allele size, which suggests that
      the mutation rate at these loci is independent of allele size.

TI  - The root of the phylogenetic tree of human populations.
PG  - 170-7
AB  - Although African populations have been shown to be most divergent from any
      other human populations, it has been difficult to establish the root of
      the phylogenetic tree of human populations since the rate of evolutionary
      change may vary from population to population owing to the fluctuation of
      population size and other factors. However, the root can be determined by
      using the chimpanzee as an outgroup and by employing proper statistical
      methods. Using this strategy, we constructed phylogenetic trees of human
      populations for five different sets of gene frequency data. The data sets
      used were two sets of microsatellite loci data (25 and 8 loci,
      respectively), restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) data (79
      loci), protein polymorphism data (15 loci), and Alu insertion frequency
      data (4 loci). All these data sets showed that the root is located in the
      branch connecting African and non-African populations, and in the four
      data sets the root was established at a significant level. These results
      indicate that Africans are the first group of people that split from the
      rest of the human populations.

TI  - Dynamics of repeat polymorphisms under a forward-backward mutation model:
      within- and between-population variability at microsatellite loci.
PG  - 549-55
AB  - Suggested molecular mechanisms for the generation of new tandem repeats of
      simple sequences indicate that the microsatellite loci evolve via some of
      forward-backward mutation. We provide a mathematical basis for suggesting
      a measure of genetic distance between populations based on microsatellite
      variation. Our results indicate that such a genetic distance measure can
      remain proportional to the divergence time of populations even when the
      forward-backward mutations produce variable and/or directionally biased
      alleles size changes. If the population size and the rate of mutation
      remain constant, then the measure will be proportional to the time of
      divergence of populations. This genetic distance is expressed in terms of
      a ratio of components of variance of allele sizes, based on expressions
      developed for studying population dynamics of quantitative traits.
      Application of this measure to data on 18 microsatellite loci in the nine
      human populations leads to evolutionary trees consistent with the known
      ethnohistory of the populations.

TI  - Microsatellite diversity and the demographic history of modern humans.
PG  - 3100-3
AB  - We have examined differences in diversity at 60 microsatellite loci among
      human population samples from three major continental groups to evaluate
      the hypothesis of greater African diversity in this rapidly evolving class
      of loci. Application of a statistical test that assumes equal mutation
      rates at all loci fails to demonstrate differences in microsatellite
      diversity, while a randomization test that does not make this assumption
      finds that Africans have significantly greater microsatellite diversity (P
      < 10(-8)) than do Asians and Europeans. Greater African diversity is most
      apparent at loci with smaller overall variance in allele size, suggesting
      that the record of population history has been erased at repeat loci with
      higher mutation rates. A power analysis shows that only 35-40
      microsatellites are needed to establish this difference statistically,
      demonstrating the considerable evolutionary information contained in these
      systems. On average, African populations have approximately 20% greater
      microsatellite diversity than do Asian and European populations. A
      comparison of continental diversity differences in microsatellites and
      mtDNA sequences suggests earlier demographic expansion of the ancestors of
      Africans.
