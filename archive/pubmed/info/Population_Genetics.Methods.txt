TI  - Y-chromosomal diversity in Europe is clinal and influenced primarily by
      geography, rather than by language.
PG  - 1526-43
AB  - Clinal patterns of autosomal genetic diversity within Europe have been
      interpreted in previous studies in terms of a Neolithic demic diffusion
      model for the spread of agriculture; in contrast, studies using mtDNA have
      traced many founding lineages to the Paleolithic and have not shown
      strongly clinal variation. We have used 11 human Y-chromosomal biallelic
      polymorphisms, defining 10 haplogroups, to analyze a sample of 3,616 Y
      chromosomes belonging to 47 European and circum-European populations.
      Patterns of geographic differentiation are highly nonrandom, and, when
      they are assessed using spatial autocorrelation analysis, they show
      significant clines for five of six haplogroups analyzed. Clines for two
      haplogroups, representing 45% of the chromosomes, are continentwide and
      consistent with the demic diffusion hypothesis. Clines for three other
      haplogroups each have different foci and are more regionally restricted
      and are likely to reflect distinct population movements, including one
      from north of the Black Sea. Principal-components analysis suggests that
      populations are related primarily on the basis of geography, rather than
      on the basis of linguistic affinity. This is confirmed in Mantel tests,
      which show a strong and highly significant partial correlation between
      genetics and geography but a low, nonsignificant partial correlation
      between genetics and language. Genetic-barrier analysis also indicates the
      primacy of geography in the shaping of patterns of variation. These
      patterns retain a strong signal of expansion from the Near East but also
      suggest that the demographic history of Europe has been complex and
      influenced by other major population movements, as well as by linguistic
      and geographic heterogeneities and the effects of drift.

TI  - Estimating divergence time with the use of microsatellite genetic
      distances: impacts of population growth and gene flow.
PG  - 700-9
AB  - Genetic distances play an important role in estimating divergence time of
      bifurcated populations. However, they can be greatly affected by
      demographic processes, such as migration and population dynamics, which
      complicate their interpretation. For example, the widely used distance for
      microsatellite loci, (deltamu)2, assumes constant population size, no gene
      flow, and mutation-drift equilibrium. It is shown here that (deltamu)2
      strongly underestimates divergence time if populations are growing and/or
      connected by gene flow. In recent publications, the average estimate of
      divergence time between African and non-African populations obtained by
      using (deltamu)2 is about 34,000 years, although archaeological data show
      a much earlier presence of modern humans out of Africa. I introduce a
      different estimator of population separation time based on microsatellite
      statistics, T(D), that does not assume mutation-drift equilibrium, is
      independent of population dynamics in the absence of gene flow, and is
      robust to weak migration flow for growing populations. However, it
      requires a knowledge of the variance in the number of repeats at the
      beginning of population separation, V(0). One way to overcome this problem
      is to find minimal and maximal bounds for the variance and thus obtain the
      earliest and latest bounds for divergence time (this is not a confidence
      interval, and it simply reflects an uncertainty about the value of V(0) in
      an ancestral population). Another way to avoid the uncertainty is to
      choose from among present populations a reference whose variation is
      presumably close to what it might have been in an ancestral population. A
      different approach for using T(D) is to estimate the time difference
      between adjacent nodes on a phylogenetic population tree. Using data on
      variation at autosomal short tandem repeat loci with di-, tri-, and
      tetranucleotide repeats in worldwide populations, T(D) gives an estimate
      of 57,000 years for the separation of the out-of-Africa branch of modern
      humans from Africans based on the value of V(0) in the Southern American
      Indian populations; the earliest bound for this event has been estimated
      to be about 135,000 years. The data also suggest that the Asian and
      European populations diverged from each other about 20,000 years, after
      the occurrence of the out-of-Africa branch.

TI  - R-matrix analysis and patterns of gene flow in India.
PG  - 57-69
AB  - An appraisal on the usefulness of R-matrix analysis and the model of
      Harpending and Ward (1982) to study the population structure of Indian
      populations is made in the light of prevalent marriage patterns, caste
      structure, and cultural specificity of the region. With the help of
      available data on the migration histories and geographical backgrounds of
      marine fishermen on the east coast of India, and through the historical
      analysis of marriage patterns, it is demonstrated that the routine
      inferences based on the regression plots of average heterozygosity versus
      genetic distance from the centroid may not generally be apt for the Indian
      situation. Increased heterozygosity among migrant fishermen seems to have
      resulted from mating patterns within this community rather than from
      external gene flow. In either case, the genetic implications are
      supposedly identical. Nevertheless, when making inferences regarding local
      population structure it is important to have detailed knowledge of mating
      patterns and the cultural context of the region under study.

TI  - A vectorized method of importance sampling with applications to models of
      mutation and migration.
PG  - 339-48
AB  - An importance-sampling method is presented for computing the likelihood of
      the configuration of population genetic data under general assumptions
      about population history and transitions among states. The configuration
      of the data is the number of chromosomes sampled that are in each of a
      finite set of states. Transitions among states are governed by a Markov
      chain with transition probabilities dependent on one or more parameters.
      The method assumes that the joint distribution of coalescence times of the
      underlying gene genealogy is independent of the genetic state of each
      lineage. Given a set of coalescence times, the probability that a pair of
      lineages is chosen to coalesce in each replicate is proportional to the
      contribution that the coalescence event makes to the probability of the
      data. This method can be applied to gene genealogies generated by the
      neutral coalescent process and to genealogies generated by other
      processes, such as a linear birth-death process which provides a good
      approximation to the dynamics of low-frequency alleles. Two applications
      are described. In the first, the fit of allele frequencies at two
      microsatellite loci sampled in a Sardinian population to the one-step
      mutation model is tested. The one-step model is rejected for one locus but
      not for the other. The second application is to low-frequency alleles in a
      geographically subdivided population. The geographic location is the
      allelic state, and the alleles are assumed to be sufficiently rare that
      their dynamics can be approximated by a linear birth-death process in
      which the birth and death rates are independent of geographic location.
      The analysis of eight low-frequency allozyme alleles found in the
      glaucous-winged gull, Larus glaucescens, illustrates how geographically
      restricted dispersal can be detected.

TI  - Influence of mutational and sampling factors on the estimation of
      demographic parameters in a "continuous" population under isolation by
      distance.
PG  - 491-502
AB  - In numerous species, individual dispersal is restricted in space so that
      "continuous" populations evolve under isolation by distance. A method
      based on individual genotypes assuming a lattice population model was
      recently developed to estimate the product Dsigma2, where D is the
      population density and sigma2 is the average squared parent-offspring
      distance. We evaluated the influence on this method of both mutation rate
      and mutation model, with a particular reference to microsatellite markers,
      as well as that of the spatial scale of sampling. Moreover, we developed
      and tested a nonparametric bootstrap procedure allowing the construction
      of confidence intervals for the estimation of Dsigma2. These two
      objectives prompted us to develop a computer simulation algorithm based on
      the coalescent theory giving individual genotypes for a continuous
      population under isolation by distance. Our results show that the
      characteristics of mutational processes at microsatellite loci, namely the
      allele size homoplasy generated by stepwise mutations, constraints on
      allele size, and change of slippage rate with repeat number, have little
      influence on the estimation of Dsigma2. In contrast, a high genetic
      diversity (approximately 0.7-0.8), as is commonly observed for
      microsatellite markers, substantially increases the precision of the
      estimation. However, very high levels of genetic diversity (>0.85) were
      found to bias the estimation. We also show that statistics taking into
      account allele size differences give unreliable estimations (i.e., high
      variance of Dsigma2 estimation) even under a strict stepwise mutation
      model. Finally, although we show that this method is reasonably robust
      with respect to the sampling scale, sampling individuals at a local
      geographical scale gives more precise estimations of Dsigma2.

TI  - DNA polymorphisms detect ancient barriers to gene flow in Basques.
PG  - 73-84
AB  - This work features the first district-by-district analysis of all
      provinces in the Iberian Peninsula with an autochthonous Basque
      population, and indicates the existence of genetic heterogeneity. The
      populations cluster in three groups arising from processes of genetic
      drift which probably occurred in pre-Mesolithic times, and were probably
      those which repopulated the southern areas of the Basque Country after the
      Last Glacial Maximum. It seems that from that period onwards, the
      population settled in three major groups (West Basques, Central Basques,
      and East Basques), along geographical axes which appear substantial in the
      maintaining of each population unit. This genetic structure is probably
      reflected in other aspects such as the existence of ancient tribes and the
      dialects of the Basque language, the boundaries of which may be related at
      origin and which are quite similar to those detected in this work. Our
      results indicate that the populations of the Basque Country are
      genetically close to other neighboring populations, such as that of
      Aragon, which may indicate an outgoing gene flow from the Basque area down
      the River Ebro towards the Mediterranean seaboard. While our short tandem
      repeat data suggest that population structure within the Basques dates
      back to the Mesolithic, our findings are also consistent with the
      hypothesis that patterns of modern European genetic diversity have been
      shaped mainly during the Neolithic.

TI  - Human X-chromosomal lineages in Europe reveal Middle Eastern and Asiatic
      contacts.
PG  - 301-11
AB  - Within Europe, classical genetic markers, nuclear autosomal and
      Y-chromosome DNA polymorphisms display an east-west frequency gradient.
      This has been taken as evidence for the westward migration of Neolithic
      farmers from the Middle East. In contrast, most studies of mtDNA variation
      in Europe and the Middle East have not revealed clinal distributions. Here
      we report an analysis of dys44 haplotypes, consisting of 35 polymorphisms
      on an 8 kb segment of the dystrophin gene on Xp21, in a sample of 1203
      Eurasian chromosomes. Our results do not show a significant genetic
      structure in Europe, though when Middle Eastern samples are included a
      very low but significant genetic structure, rooted in Middle Eastern
      heterogeneity, is observed. This structure was not correlated to either
      geography or language, indicating that neither of these factors are a
      barrier to gene flow within Europe and/or the Middle East. Spatial
      autocorrelation analysis did not show clinal variation from the Middle
      East to Europe, though an underlying and ancient east-west cline across
      the Eurasian continent was detected. Clines provide a strong signal of
      ancient major population migration(s), and we suggest that the observed
      cline likely resulted from an ancient, bifurcating migration out of Africa
      that influenced the colonizing of Europe, Asia and the Americas. Our study
      reveals that, in addition to settlements from the Near East, Europe has
      been influenced by other major population movements, such as expansion(s)
      from Asia, as well as by recent gene flow from within Europe and the
      Middle East.

TI  - A novel measure of genetic distance for highly polymorphic tandem repeat
      loci.
PG  - 914-20
AB  - Genetic distance measures are indicators of relatedness among populations
      or species and are useful for reconstructing the historic and phylogenetic
      relationships among such groups. Classical measures of genetic distance
      were developed to analyze biochemical and serological polymorphisms,
      systems which generally show limited variability. However, these
      traditional measures of genetic distance are inadequate for the analysis
      of certain classes of variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) loci, which
      have a larger number of alleles and higher levels of heterozygosity than
      traditional genetic markers. At the higher levels of heterozygosity
      observed at these loci, the standard measures of genetic distance are
      nonlinear and do not account for the mutational mechanisms of
      hypervariable loci. We have developed a measure of genetic distance, DSW,
      which is appropriate for the analysis of highly polymorphic DNA loci.
      Using computer simulations of diverging populations, we show that DSW
      conforms to linearity and that the variance is similar in magnitude to
      traditional measures of genetic distance. Comparisons of phylogenetic
      trees derived from the simulated divergence of human racial groups
      demonstrate that the branch lengths of trees prepared using DSW are more
      similar to the model tree than those generated using other measures.
      Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of DSW to evolutionary analysis
      by reconstructing the relationships among eight human populations using 14
      microsatellite and STR loci. The phylogenetic trees generated using DSW
      are different from trees constructed with traditional measures and better
      reflect the well-documented ancient divergence of African and non-African
      populations.

TI  - An evaluation of genetic distances for use with microsatellite loci.
PG  - 463-71
AB  - Mutations of alleles at microsatellite loci tend to result in alleles with
      repeat scores similar to those of the alleles from which they were
      derived. Therefore the difference in repeat score between alleles carries
      information about the amount of time that has passed since they shared a
      common ancestral allele. This information is ignored by genetic distances
      based on the infinite alleles model. Here we develop a genetic distance
      based on the stepwise mutation model that includes allelic repeat score.
      We adapt earlier treatments of the stepwise mutation model to show
      analytically that the expectation of this distance is a linear function of
      time. We then use computer simulations to evaluate the overall reliability
      of this distance and to compare it with allele sharing and Nei's distance.
      We find that no distance is uniformly superior for all purposes, but that
      for phylogenetic reconstruction of taxa that are sufficiently diverged,
      our new distance is preferable.

TI  - Mitochondrial portraits of human populations using median networks.
PG  - 743-53
AB  - Analysis of variation in the hypervariable region of mitochondrial DNA
      (mtDNA) has emerged as an important tool for studying human evolution and
      migration. However, attempts to reconstruct optimal intraspecific mtDNA
      phylogenies frequently fail because parallel mutation events partly
      obscure the true evolutionary pathways. This makes it inadvisable to
      present a single phylogenetic tree at the expense of neglecting equally
      acceptable ones. As an alternative, we propose a novel network approach
      for portraying mtDNA relationships. For small sample sizes (<
      approximately 50), an unmodified median network contains all most
      parsimonious trees, displays graphically the full information content of
      the sequence data, and can easily be generated by hand. For larger sample
      sizes, we reduce the complexity of the network by identifying
      parallelisms. This reduction procedure is guided by a compatibility
      argument and an additional source of phylogenetic information: the
      frequencies of the mitochondrial haplotypes. As a spin-off, our approach
      can also assist in identifying sequencing errors, which manifest
      themselves in implausible network substructures. We illustrate the
      advantages of our approach with several examples from existing data sets.

TI  - Ascertainment bias in estimates of average heterozygosity.
PG  - 1033-41
AB  - Population geneticists work with a nonrandom sample of the human genome.
      Conventional practice ensures that unusually variable loci are most likely
      to be discovered and thus included in the sample of loci. Consequently,
      estimates of average heterozygosity are biased upward. In what follows we
      describe a model of this bias. When the mutation rate varies among loci,
      bias is increased. This effect is only moderate, however, so that a model
      of invariant mutation rates provides a reasonable approximation. Bias is
      pronounced when estimated heterozygosity is < approximately 35%
      Consequently, it probably affects estimates from classical polymorphisms
      as well as from restriction-site polymorphisms. Estimates from
      short-tandem-repeat polymorphisms have negligible bias, because of their
      high heterozygosity. Bias should vary not only among categories of
      polymorphism but also among populations. It should be largest in European
      populations, since these are the populations in which most polymorphisms
      were discovered. As this argument predicts, European estimates exceed
      those of Africa and Asia at systems with large bias. The magnitude of this
      European excess is consistent with the version of our model in which
      mutation rates vary across loci.

TI  - The apportionment of dinucleotide repeat diversity in Native Americans and
      Europeans: a new approach to measuring gene identity reveals asymmetric
      patterns of divergence.
PG  - 943-53
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to assess the extent of gene identity and
      differentiation at 33 dinucleotide repeat loci (377 total alleles) within
      and among three European and three Native American populations. In order
      to do this, we show that a maximum-likelihood method proposed for
      phylogenetic trees (Cavalli-Sforza and Piazza 1975) can be used to
      estimate gene identity (Nei 1987) with respect to any hierarchical
      structure. This method allows gene differentiation to be evaluated with
      respect to any internal node of a hierarchy. It also allows a
      generalization of F- and G-statistics to situations with unequal expected
      levels of differentiation. Our principal finding is that levels of genetic
      differentiation are unique to specific populations and levels of nesting.
      The populations of European origin show very little internal
      differentiation; moreover, their continental average is close to the total
      population defined by the aggregate of Europeans and Native Americans. By
      contrast, the Native American populations show moderate levels of internal
      differentiation, and a great distance between their continental average
      and the total. The results of analyses of subsets of loci that were
      selected to have high gene diversities in either Europeans or Native
      Americans closely parallel those from the total set of loci. This suggests
      that the principal results are unlikely to be caused by a European
      ascertainment bias in locus selection. In summary, our findings
      demonstrate that partitions of gene diversity into within- and
      between-populations components are heavily biased by the populations
      analyzed and the models fitted. Optimistically, however, more information
      is available to analyze population history and evolution by quantifying,
      as we have done, the uniqueness of patterns of differentiation.

TI  - Genetic distances and reconstruction of phylogenetic trees from
      microsatellite DNA.
PG  - 389-99
AB  - Recently many investigators have used microsatellite DNA loci for studying
      the evolutionary relationships of closely related populations or species,
      and some authors proposed new genetic distance measures for this purpose.
      However, the efficiencies of these distance measures in obtaining the
      correct tree topology remains unclear. We therefore investigated the
      probability of obtaining the correct topology (PC) for these new distances
      as well as traditional distance measures by using computer simulation. We
      used both the infinite-allele model (IAM) and the stepwise mutation model
      (SMM), which seem to be appropriate for classical markers and
      microsatellite loci, respectively. The results show that in both the IAM
      and SMM CAVALLI-SFORZA and EDWARDS' chord distance (DC) and NEI et al.'s
      DA distance generally show higher PC values than other distance measures,
      whether the bottleneck effect exists or not. For estimating evolutionary
      times, however, NEI's standard distance and GOLDSTEIN et al.'s (delta mu)2
      are more appropriate than other distances. Microsatellite DNA seems to be
      very useful for clarifying the evolutionary relationships of closely
      related populations.

TI  - Microsatellite variation and the differentiation of modern humans.
PG  - 1-7
AB  - This study presents an analysis of 20 tetranucleotide microsatellites in
      16 worldwide human populations representing the major geographic groups.
      Global Fst values for the 20 microsatellites are indicators of their
      relative validity as tools in human population genetics. Four different
      measures of genetic distance (Fst, DSW, delta mu 2 and Rst) have been
      tested and compared with each other. Neighbor-joining trees have been
      constructed for all the measures of genetic distance and populations.
      Measures of genetic distance such as Fst, which does not consider
      different mutational relationships among alleles and has a known
      relationship to differentiation by drift, and to some extent DSW, reflect
      what is known of human evolution, while mutation-based distances such as
      Rst and delta mu 2 give very different results from those recognized from
      other sources (genetic or archaeological). When the genetic relationship
      between human populations is analyzed through allelic frequencies for
      microsatellites, the choice of distance may be a key issue in the picture
      obtained of genetic relationships between human populations. The results
      of the present study suggest that genetic drift played the main role in
      generating the present distributions of microsatellite alleles and their
      variation among human populations; the role of mutation must have been
      less important owing to the time constraint imposed by the small timescale
      in which most human differentiation has occurred. Moreover, the results
      support the theory of a recent origin of modern humans, although the
      existence of strong bottlenecks in the origin of the various human groups
      seems unlikely.

TI  - Using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA markers to reconstruct human
      evolution.
PG  - 126-36
AB  - Molecular genetic-data have greatly improved our ability to test
      hypotheses about human evolution. During the past decade, a large amount
      of nuclear and mitochondrial data have been collected from diverse human
      populations. Taken together, these data indicate that modern humans are a
      relatively young species. African populations show the largest amount of
      genetic diversity, and they are the most genetically divergent population.
      Modern human populations expanded in size first on the African continent.
      These findings support a recent African origin of modern humans, but this
      conclusion should be tempered by the possible effects of factors such as
      gene flow, population size differences, and natural selection.
