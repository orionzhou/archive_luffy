AB  - BACKGROUND: We reasoned that by identifying genetic markers on human X
      chromosome regions where recombination is rare or absent, we should be
      able to construct X chromosome genealogies analogous to those based on Y
      chromosome and mitochondrial DNA polymorphisms, with the advantage of
      providing information about both male and female components of the
      population. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We identified a 47 Kb interval
      containing an Alu insertion polymorphism (DXS225) and four microsatellites
      in complete linkage disequilibrium in a low recombination rate region of
      the long arm of the human X chromosome. This haplotype block was studied
      in 667 males from the HGDP-CEPH Human Genome Diversity Panel. The
      haplotypic diversity was highest in Africa (0.992+/-0.0025) and lowest in
      the Americas (0.839+/-0.0378), where no insertion alleles of DXS225 were
      observed. Africa shared few haplotypes with other geographical areas,
      while those exhibited significant sharing among themselves. Median joining
      networks revealed that the African haplotypes were numerous, occupied the
      periphery of the graph and had low frequency, whereas those from the other
      continents were few, central and had high frequency. Altogether, our data
      support a single origin of modern man in Africa and migration to occupy
      the other continents by serial founder effects. Coalescent analysis
      permitted estimation of the time of the most recent common ancestor as
      182,000 years (56,700-479,000) and the estimated time of the DXS225 Alu
      insertion of 94,400 years (24,300-310,000). These dates are fully
      compatible with the current widely accepted scenario of the origin of
      modern mankind in Africa within the last 195,000 years and migration
      out-of-Africa circa 55,000-65,000 years ago. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: A
      haplotypic block combining an Alu insertion polymorphism and four
      microsatellite markers on the human X chromosome is a useful marker to
      evaluate genetic diversity of human populations and provides a highly
      informative tool for evolutionary studies.
