TI  - Sex-specific migration patterns in Central Asian populations, revealed by
      analysis of Y-chromosome short tandem repeats and mtDNA.
PG  - 208-19
AB  - Eight Y-linked short-tandem-repeat polymorphisms (DYS19, DYS388, DYS389I,
      DYS389II, DYS390, DYS391, DYS392, and DYS393) were analyzed in four
      populations of Central Asia, comprising two lowland samples-Uighurs and
      lowland Kirghiz-and two highland samples-namely, the Kazakhs (altitude
      2,500 m above sea level) and highland Kirghiz (altitude 3,200 m above sea
      level). The results were compared with mtDNA sequence data on the same
      individuals, to study possible differences in male versus female
      genetic-variation patterns in these Central Asian populations. Analysis of
      molecular variance (AMOVA) showed a very high degree of genetic
      differentiation among the populations tested, in discordance with the
      results obtained with mtDNA sequences, which showed high homogeneity.
      Moreover, a dramatic reduction of the haplotype genetic diversity was
      observed in the villages at high altitude, especially in the highland
      Kirghiz, when compared with the villages at low altitude, which suggests a
      male founder effect in the settlement of high-altitude lands. Nonetheless,
      mtDNA genetic diversity in these highland populations is equivalent to
      that in the lowland populations. The present results suggest a very
      different migration pattern in males versus females, in an extended
      historical frame, with a higher migration rate for females.

TI  - A view of modern human origins from Y chromosome microsatellite variation.
PG  - 558-67
AB  - The idea that all modern humans share a recent (within the last 150, 000
      years) African origin has been proposed and supported on the basis of
      three observations. Most genetic loci examined to date have (1) shown
      greater diversity in African populations than in others, (2) placed the
      first branch between African and all non-African populations in
      phylogenetic trees, and (3) indicated recent dates for either the
      molecular coalescence (with the exception of some autosomal and
      X-chromosomal loci) or for the time of separation between African and
      non-African populations. We analyze variation at 10 Y chromosome
      microsatellite loci that were typed in 506 males representing 49
      populations and every inhabited continent and find significantly greater Y
      chromosome diversity in Africa than elsewhere, find the first branch in
      phylogenetic trees of the continental populations to fall between African
      and all non-African populations, and date this branching with the
      (deltamu)2 distance measure to 5800-17,400 or 12,800-36,800 years BP
      depending on the mutation rate used. The magnitude of the excess Y
      chromosome diversity in African populations appears to result from a
      greater antiquity of African populations rather than a greater long-term
      effective population size. These observations are most consistent with a
      recent African origin for all modern humans.

TI  - Combined use of biallelic and microsatellite Y-chromosome polymorphisms to
      infer affinities among African populations.
PG  - 829-46
AB  - To define Y-chromosome haplotypes, we studied seven biallelic polymorphic
      sites. We combined data with those from four dinucleotide-repeat
      polymorphisms, to establish Y-chromosome compound superhaplotypes. Eight
      biallelic haplotypes that matched the dendrogram proposed by other
      investigators were identified in 762 Y chromosomes from 25 African
      populations. For each biallelic site, coalescence time of lineages
      carrying the derived allele was estimated and compared with previous
      estimates. The "ancestral" haplotype (haplotype 1A) was observed among
      Ethiopians, "Khoisan" (!Kung and Khwe), and populations from northern
      Cameroon. Microsatellite distributions within this haplotype showed that
      the Khoisan haplotypes 1A are widely divergent from those of the other two
      groups. Populations from northern Africa and northern Cameroon share a
      haplotype (i.e., 1C), which is not observed in other African populations
      but represents a major Eurasian cluster. Haplotypes 1C of northern
      Cameroon are clearly distinct from those of Europe, whereas haplotypes 1C
      of northern African are well intermingled with those of the other two
      groups. Apportionment of diversity for the Y-chromosomal biallelic
      haplotypes was calculated after populations were clustered into different
      configurations. Despite some correspondence between language affiliation
      and genetic similarity, geographic proximity seems to be a better
      predictor of genetic affinity.

TI  - Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis of human Y-chromosome microsatellites
      provides evidence of biased mutation.
PG  - 11916-21
AB  - We describe a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis of five human Y-
      chromosome microsatellite polymorphisms based on samples from five diverse
      populations. Our analysis provides strong evidence for mutational bias
      favoring increase in length at all loci. Estimates of population
      coalescent times and population size from our two largest samples, one
      African and one European, suggest that the African population is older but
      smaller and that the English East Anglian population has undergone
      significant expansion, being larger but younger. We conclude that Markov
      Chain Monte Carlo analysis of microsatellite haplotypes can uncover
      information not apparent when the microsatellites are considered
      independently. Incorporation of population size as a variable should allow
      us to estimate the timing and magnitude of major historical population
      trends.

TI  - Variation in short tandem repeats is deeply structured by genetic
      background on the human Y chromosome.
PG  - 1623-38
AB  - Eleven biallelic polymorphisms and seven short-tandem-repeat (STR) loci
      mapping on the nonrecombining portion of the human Y chromosome have been
      typed in men from northwestern Africa. Analysis of the biallelic markers,
      which represent probable unique events in human evolution, allowed us to
      characterize the stable backgrounds or haplogroups of Y chromosomes that
      prevail in this geographic region. Variation in the more rapidly mutating
      genetic markers (STRs) has been used both to estimate the time to the most
      recent common ancestor for STR variability within these stable backgrounds
      and to explore whether STR differentiation among haplogroups still retains
      information about their phylogeny. When analysis of molecular variance was
      used to study the apportionment of STR variation among both genetic
      backgrounds (i.e., those defined by haplogroups) and population
      backgrounds, we found STR variability to be clearly structured by
      haplogroups. More than 80% of the genetic variance was found among
      haplogroups, whereas only 3.72% of the genetic variation could be
      attributed to differences among populations-that is, genetic variability
      appears to be much more structured by lineage than by population. This was
      confirmed when two population samples from the Iberian Peninsula were
      added to the analysis. The deep structure of the genetic variation in old
      genealogical units (haplogroups) challenges a population-based perspective
      in the comprehension of human genome diversity. A population may be better
      understood as an association of lineages from a deep and
      population-independent gene genealogy, rather than as a complete
      evolutionary unit.

PG  - 153-66
AB  - Two hypervariable Y-specific markers, the YCAII and DYS19 STRs, and the
      more stable Y Alu Polymorphism (YAP) have been analysed in about 1400
      individuals of 21 different populations, mainly from Europe but also from
      the Middle East, Africa and Asia. On the basis of the frequency
      distributions of these three Y-markers we compare, using different
      statistical analyses, their power in detecting population genetic
      structure and in distinguishing closely related groups. The pattern of
      populations' genetic affinities inferred from the three markers considered
      altogether suggests a strong genetic structure that, with a few
      exceptions, broadly corresponds to the linguistic relatedness and/or
      geographic location of the sampled populations.

TI  - A short tandem repeat-based phylogeny for the human Y chromosome.
PG  - 182-96
AB  - Human Y-chromosomal short tandem repeat (STR) data provide a potential
      model system for the understanding of autosomal STR mutations in humans
      and other species. Yet, the reconstruction of STR evolution is rarely
      attempted, because of the absence of an appropriate methodology. We here
      develop and validate a phylogenetic-network approach. We have typed 256 Y
      chromosomes of indigenous descent from Africa, Asia, Europe, Australia,
      and highland Papua New Guinea, for the STR loci DYS19, DXYS156Y, DYS389,
      DYS390, DYS392, and DYS393, as well as for five ancient biallelic mutation
      events: two poly (A) length variants associated with the YAP insertion,
      two independent SRY-1532 mutations, and the 92R7 mutation. We have used
      our previously published pedigree data from 11,000 paternity-tested
      autosomal STR-allele transfers to produce a two-class weighting system for
      the Y-STR loci that is based on locus lengths and motif lengths.
      Reduced-median-network analysis yields a phylogeny that is independently
      supported by the five biallelic mutations, with an error of 6%. We find
      the earliest branch in our African San (Bushmen) sample. Assuming an age
      of 20,000 years for the Native American DYS199 T mutation, we estimate a
      mutation rate of 2.6x10-4 mutations/20 years for slowly mutating Y STRs,
      approximately 10-fold slower than the published average pedigree rate.

TI  - Population genetic implications from sequence variation in four Y
      chromosome genes.
PG  - 7354-9
AB  - Some insight into human evolution has been gained from the sequencing of
      four Y chromosome genes. Primary genomic sequencing determined gene SMCY
      to be composed of 27 exons that comprise 4,620 bp of coding sequence. The
      unfinished sequencing of the 5' portion of gene UTY1 was completed by
      primer walking, and a total of 20 exons were found. By using denaturing
      HPLC, these two genes, as well as DBY and DFFRY, were screened for
      polymorphic sites in 53-72 representatives of the five continents. A total
      of 98 variants were found, yielding nucleotide diversity estimates of 2.45
      x 10(-5), 5. 07 x 10(-5), and 8.54 x 10(-5) for the coding regions of
      SMCY, DFFRY, and UTY1, respectively, with no variant having been observed
      in DBY. In agreement with most autosomal genes, diversity estimates for
      the noncoding regions were about 2- to 3-fold higher and ranged from 9. 16
      x 10(-5) to 14.2 x 10(-5) for the four genes. Analysis of the frequencies
      of derived alleles for all four genes showed that they more closely fit
      the expectation of a Luria-Delbruck distribution than a distribution
      expected under a constant population size model, providing evidence for
      exponential population growth. Pairwise nucleotide mismatch distributions
      date the occurrence of population expansion to approximately 28,000 years
      ago. This estimate is in accord with the spread of Aurignacian technology
      and the disappearance of the Neanderthals.

      globally dispersed human populations.
PG  - 990-1018
AB  - The genetic variance at seven Y-chromosomal microsatellite loci (or short
      tandem repeats [STRs]) was studied among 986 male individuals from 20
      globally dispersed human populations. A total of 598 different haplotypes
      were observed, of which 437 (73.1%) were each found in a single male only.
      Population-specific haplotype-diversity values were.86-.99. Analyses of
      haplotype diversity and population-specific haplotypes revealed marked
      population-structure differences between more-isolated indigenous
      populations (e.g., Central African Pygmies or Greenland Inuit) and
      more-admixed populations (e.g., Europeans or Surinamese). Furthermore,
      male individuals from isolated indigenous populations shared haplotypes
      mainly with male individuals from their own population. By analysis of
      molecular variance, we found that 76.8% of the total genetic variance
      present among these male individuals could be attributed to genetic
      differences between male individuals who were members of the same
      population. Haplotype sharing between populations, phi(ST) statistics, and
      phylogenetic analysis identified close genetic affinities among European
      populations and among New Guinean populations. Our data illustrate that
      Y-chromosomal STR haplotypes are an ideal tool for the study of the
      genetic affinities between groups of male subjects and for detection of
      population structure.

TI  - The Human Y Chromosome: The Biological Role of a "Functional Wasteland"
PG  - 18-24
AB  - "Functional wasteland," "Nonrecombining desert" and "Gene-poor chromosome"
      are only some examples of the different definitions given to the Y
      chromosome in the last decade. In comparison to the other chromosomes, the
      Y is poor in genes, being more than 50% of its sequence composed of
      repeated elements. Moreover, the Y genes are in continuous decay probably
      due to the lack of recombination of this chromosome. But the human Y
      chromosome, at the same time, plays a central role in human biology. The
      presence or absence of this chromosome determines gonadal sex. Thus,
      mammalian embryos with a Y chromosome develop testes, while those without
      it develop ovaries (Polani, 1981). What is responsible for the male
      phenotype is the testis-determining SRY gene (Sinclair, 1990) which
      remains the most distinguishing characteristic of this chromosome. In
      addition to SRY, the presence of other genes with important functions has
      been reported, including a region associated to Turner estigmata, a gene
      related to the development of gonadoblastoma and, most important, genes
      related to germ cell development and maintenance and then, related with
      male fertility (Lahn and Page, 1997). This paper reviews the structure and
      the biological functions of this peculiar chromosome.

TI  - The male-specific region of the human Y chromosome is a mosaic of discrete
      sequence classes.
PG  - 825-37
AB  - The male-specific region of the Y chromosome, the MSY, differentiates the
      sexes and comprises 95% of the chromosome's length. Here, we report that
      the MSY is a mosaic of heterochromatic sequences and three classes of
      euchromatic sequences: X-transposed, X-degenerate and ampliconic. These
      classes contain all 156 known transcription units, which include 78
      protein-coding genes that collectively encode 27 distinct proteins. The
      X-transposed sequences exhibit 99% identity to the X chromosome. The
      X-degenerate sequences are remnants of ancient autosomes from which the
      modern X and Y chromosomes evolved. The ampliconic class includes large
      regions (about 30% of the MSY euchromatin) where sequence pairs show
      greater than 99.9% identity, which is maintained by frequent gene
      conversion (non-reciprocal transfer). The most prominent features here are
      eight massive palindromes, at least six of which contain testis genes.

TI  - The human Y chromosome: an evolutionary marker comes of age.
PG  - 598-612
AB  - Until recently, the Y chromosome seemed to fulfil the role of juvenile
      delinquent among human chromosomes--rich in junk, poor in useful
      attributes, reluctant to socialize with its neighbours and with an
      inescapable tendency to degenerate. The availability of the near-complete
      chromosome sequence, plus many new polymorphisms, a highly resolved
      phylogeny and insights into its mutation processes, now provide new
      avenues for investigating human evolution. Y-chromosome research is
      growing up.

TI  - Y-chromosome evidence for differing ancient demographic histories in the
      Americas.
PG  - 524-39
AB  - To scrutinize the male ancestry of extant Native American populations, we
      examined eight biallelic and six microsatellite polymorphisms from the
      nonrecombining portion of the Y chromosome, in 438 individuals from 24
      Native American populations (1 Na Dene and 23 South Amerinds) and in 404
      Mongolians. One of the biallelic markers typed is a recently identified
      mutation (M242) characterizing a novel founder Native American haplogroup.
      The distribution, relatedness, and diversity of Y lineages in Native
      Americans indicate a differentiated male ancestry for populations from
      North and South America, strongly supporting a diverse demographic history
      for populations from these areas. These data are consistent with the
      occurrence of two major male migrations from southern/central Siberia to
      the Americas (with the second migration being restricted to North America)
      and a shared ancestry in central Asia for some of the initial migrants to
      Europe and the Americas. The microsatellite diversity and distribution of
      a Y lineage specific to South America (Q-M19) indicates that certain
      Amerind populations have been isolated since the initial colonization of
      the region, suggesting an early onset for tribalization of Native
      Americans. Age estimates based on Y-chromosome microsatellite diversity
      place the initial settlement of the American continent at approximately
      14,000 years ago, in relative agreement with the age of well-established
      archaeological evidence.

TI  - Human population structure and its effects on sampling Y chromosome
      sequence variation.
PG  - 1495-509
AB  - The excess of rare variants in global sequencing studies of the
      nonrecombining portion of the Y chromosome (NRY) has been interpreted as
      evidence for the effects of human demographic expansion. However, many NRY
      polymorphisms are geographically localized and the effect of different
      geographical sampling on patterns of NRY variation is unknown. We use two
      sampling designs to detect population structure and its effects on
      patterns of human NRY polymorphism. First, we sequence 26.5 kb of
      noncoding Y chromosome DNA from 92 globally distributed males representing
      35 populations. We find that the number of polymorphisms with singleton
      variants is positively correlated with the number of populations sampled
      and that there is a significant negative correlation of Tajima's D (TD)
      and Fu and Li's D (FD) statistics with the number of pooled populations.
      We then sequence the same region in a total of 73 males sampled from 3
      distinct populations and find that TD and FD values for the 3 pooled and
      individual population samples were much less negative than those in the
      aforementioned global sample. Coalescent simulations show that a simple
      splitting model of population structure, with no changes in population
      size, is sufficient to produce the negative values of TD seen in our
      pooled samples. These empirical and simulation results suggest that
      observed levels of NRY population structure may lead to an upward bias in
      the number of singleton variants in global surveys and call into question
      inferences of population expansion based on global sampling strategies.

TI  - Y-chromosomal DNA haplogroups and their implications for the dual origins
      of the Koreans.
PG  - 27-35
AB  - We have analyzed eight Y-chromosomal binary markers (YAP, RPS4Y(711), M9,
      M175, LINE1, SRY(+465), 47z, and M95) and three Y-STR markers (DYS390,
      DYS391, and DYS393) in 738 males from 11 ethnic groups in east Asia in
      order to study the male lineage history of Korea. Haplogroup DE-YAP was
      found at a high frequency only in Japan but was also present at low
      frequencies in northeast Asia, including 2.5% in Korea, suggesting a
      northern origin for these chromosomes. Haplogroup C-RPS4Y(711) was present
      in Korea and Manchuria at moderate frequencies: higher than in populations
      from southeast Asia, but lower than those in the northeast, which may
      imply a northern Asian expansion of these lineages, perhaps from Mongolia
      or Siberia. The major Y-chromosomal expansions in east Asia were those of
      haplogroup O-M175 (and its sublineages). This haplogroup is likely to have
      originated in southern east Asia and subsequently expanded to all of east
      Asia. The moderate frequency of one sublineage in the Koreans, haplogroup
      O-LINE1 (12.5%), could be a result of interaction with Chinese
      populations. The age of another sublineage, haplogroup O-SRY(+465), and
      Y-STR haplotype diversity provide evidence for relatively recent male
      migration, originally from China, through Korea into Japan. In conclusion,
      the distribution pattern of Y-chromosomal haplogroups reveals the complex
      origin of the Koreans, resulting from genetic contributions involving the
      northern Asian settlement and range expansions mostly from
      southern-to-northern China.

TI  - Protein structure prediction for the male-specific region of the human Y
      chromosome.
PG  - 2305-10
AB  - The complete sequence of the male-specific region of the human Y
      chromosome (MSY) has been determined recently; however, detailed
      characterization for many of its encoded proteins still remains to be
      done. We applied state-of-the-art protein structure prediction methods to
      all 27 distinct MSY-encoded proteins to provide better understanding of
      their biological functions and their mechanisms of action at the molecular
      level. The results of such large-scale structure-functional annotation
      provide a comprehensive view of the MSY proteome, shedding light on
      MSY-related processes. We found that, in total, at least 60 domains are
      encoded by 27 distinct MSY genes, of which 42 (70%) were reliably mapped
      to currently known structures. The most challenging predictions include
      the unexpected but confident 3D structure assignments for three domains
      identified here encoded by the USP9Y, UTY, and BPY2 genes. The domains
      with unknown 3D structures that are not predictable with currently
      available theoretical methods are established as primary targets for
      crystallographic or NMR studies. The data presented here set up the basis
      for additional scientific discoveries in human biology of the Y
      chromosome, which plays a fundamental role in sex determination.

TI  - Phylogeography of Y-chromosome haplogroup I reveals distinct domains of
      prehistoric gene flow in europe.
PG  - 128-37
AB  - To investigate which aspects of contemporary human Y-chromosome variation
      in Europe are characteristic of primary colonization, late-glacial
      expansions from refuge areas, Neolithic dispersals, or more recent events
      of gene flow, we have analyzed, in detail, haplogroup I (Hg I), the only
      major clade of the Y phylogeny that is widespread over Europe but
      virtually absent elsewhere. The analysis of 1,104 Hg I Y chromosomes,
      which were identified in the survey of 7,574 males from 60 population
      samples, revealed several subclades with distinct geographic
      distributions. Subclade I1a accounts for most of Hg I in Scandinavia, with
      a rapidly decreasing frequency toward both the East European Plain and the
      Atlantic fringe, but microsatellite diversity reveals that France could be
      the source region of the early spread of both I1a and the less common I1c.
      Also, I1b*, which extends from the eastern Adriatic to eastern Europe and
      declines noticeably toward the southern Balkans and abruptly toward the
      periphery of northern Italy, probably diffused after the Last Glacial
      Maximum from a homeland in eastern Europe or the Balkans. In contrast,
      I1b2 most likely arose in southern France/Iberia. Similarly to the other
      subclades, it underwent a postglacial expansion and marked the human
      colonization of Sardinia approximately 9,000 years ago.

PG  - 339-48
AB  - Y-chromosomes from 76 Chinese men covering 33 ethnic minorities throughout
      China as well as the Han majority were collected as genetic material for
      the study of Chinese nonrecombinant Y-chromosome (NRY) phylogeny. Of the
      accepted worldwide NRY haplogroups, three (haplogroups D, C, O) were
      significant in this sample, extending previous assessments of Chinese
      genetic diversity. Based on geographic, linguistic, and ethnohistorical
      information, the 33 Chinese ethnic minorities in our survey were divided
      into the following four subgroups: North, Tibet, West, and South. Inferred
      from the distribution of the newly found immediate ancestor lineage
      haplogroup O*, which has M214 but not M175, we argue that the southern
      origin scenario of this most common Chinese Y haplogroup is not very
      likely. We tentatively propose a West/North-origin hypothesis, suggesting
      that haplogroup O originated in West/North China and mainly evolved in
      China and thence spread further throughout eastern Eurasia. The nested
      cladistic analysis revealed in detail a multilayered, multidirectional,
      and continuous history of ethnic admixture that has shaped the
      contemporary Chinese population. Our results give some new clues to the
      evolution and migration of the Chinese population and its subsequence
      moving about in this land, which are in accordance with the historical
      records.

AB  - We have analyzed 11 Y-STR loci (DYS19, the two DYS385 loci, DYS388,

      was 0.9997; using only the nine Y-STRs comprising the "minimal haplotype"
      (excluding DYS388 and DXYS156Y) it was 0.9996, a value similar to that
      found in 1924 samples from other Asian populations (0.9996; Lessig et al.
      Legal Medicine 5(2003) 160-163), and slightly higher than in European
      populations (0.9976; n=11,610; Roewer et al. For Sci International (2001)
      118:103-111). All of the individual east Asian populations examined here
      had high haplotype diversity (> or =0.997), except for the Mongolians
      (0.992) and Manchurians (0.960). The most frequent haplotype identified by
      the nine markers was present at only 1% (7/700). Population comparisons
      based on Phi(ST) or rho genetic distance measures revealed clustering
      according to the traditional northeast-southeast distinction, but with
      exceptions. For example, the Yunnan population from southern China lay
      among the northern populations, possibly reflecting recent migration,
      while the Korean population, traditionally considered northern, lay at the
      boundary between northern and southern populations. An admixture estimate
      suggested 55(51-59)% northern, 45(41-49)% southern contribution to the
      Koreans, illustrating the complexity of the genetic history of this
      region.

PG  - 591-604
AB  - In order to investigate the genetic history of autochthonous South
      Siberian populations and to estimate the contribution of distinct
      patrilineages to their gene pools, we have analyzed 17 Y-chromosomal
      binary markers (YAP, RPS4Y(711), SRY-8299, M89, M201, M52, M170, 12f2, M9,
      M20, 92R7, SRY-1532, DYS199, M173, M17, Tat, and LLY22 g) in a total
      sample of 1,358 males from 14 ethnic groups of Siberia (Altaians-Kizhi,
      Teleuts, Shors, Tuvinians, Todjins, Tofalars, Sojots, Khakassians,
      Buryats, Evenks), Central/Eastern Asia (Mongolians and Koreans) and
      Eastern Europe (Kalmyks and Russians). Based on both, the distribution
      pattern of Y-chromosomal haplogroups and results on AMOVA analysis we
      observed the statistically significant genetic differentiation between the
      populations of Baikal and Altai-Sayan regions. We suggest that these
      regional differences can be best explained by different contribution of
      Central/Eastern Asian and Eastern European paternal lineages into gene
      pools of modern South Siberians. The population of the Baikal region
      demonstrates the prevalence of Central/Eastern Asian lineages, whereas in
      the populations of Altai and Sayan regions the highest paternal
      contribution resulted from Eastern European descent is revealed. Yet, our
      data on Y-chromosome STRs variation demonstrate the clear differences
      between the South Siberian and Eastern European R1a1-lineages with the
      evolutionary ages compatible with divergence time between these two
      regional groups.

TI  - Dual origins of the Japanese: common ground for hunter-gatherer and farmer
      Y chromosomes.
PG  - 47-58
AB  - Historic Japanese culture evolved from at least two distinct migrations
      that originated on the Asian continent. Hunter-gatherers arrived before
      land bridges were submerged after the last glacial maximum (>12,000 years
      ago) and gave rise to the Jomon culture, and the Yayoi migration brought
      wet rice agriculture from Korea beginning approximately 2,300 years ago. A
      set of 81 Y chromosome single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was used to
      trace the origins of Paleolithic and Neolithic components of the Japanese
      paternal gene pool, and to determine the relative contribution of Jomon
      and Yayoi Y chromosome lineages to modern Japanese. Our global sample
      consisted of >2,500 males from 39 Asian populations, including six
      populations sampled from across the Japanese archipelago. Japanese
      populations were characterized by the presence of two major (D and O) and
      two minor (C and N) clades of Y chromosomes, each with several
      sub-lineages. Haplogroup D chromosomes were present at 34.7% and were
      distributed in a U-shaped pattern with the highest frequency in the
      northern Ainu and southern Ryukyuans. In contrast, haplogroup O lineages
      (51.8%) were distributed in an inverted U-shaped pattern with a maximum
      frequency on Kyushu. Coalescent analyses of Y chromosome short tandem
      repeat diversity indicated that haplogroups D and C began their expansions
      in Japan approximately 20,000 and approximately 12,000 years ago,
      respectively, while haplogroup O-47z began its expansion only
      approximately 4,000 years ago. We infer that these patterns result from
      separate and distinct genetic contributions from both the Jomon and the
      Yayoi cultures to modern Japanese, with varying levels of admixture
      between these two populations across the archipelago. The results also
      support the hypothesis of a Central Asian origin of Jomonese ancestors,
      and a Southeast Asian origin of the ancestors of the Yayoi, contra
      previous models based on morphological and genetic evidence.

TI  - Comprehensive annotated STR physical map of the human Y chromosome:
      Forensic implications.
PG  - 110-20
AB  - A plethora of Y-STR markers from diverse sources have been deposited in
      public databases and represent potential candidates for incorporation into
      the next generation of Y-STR multiplexes for forensic use. Here, based
      upon all of the Y-STR loci that have been deposited in the human genome
      database (>400), we have sequentially positioned each one along the Y
      chromosome using the most current human genome sequencing data (NCBI Build
      35). The information derived from this work defines the number and
      relative position of all potentially forensically relevant Y-STR loci,
      their location within the physical linkage map of the Y chromosome and
      their relationship to structural genes. We conclude that there exists at
      present at least 417 separate Y-STR markers available for potential
      forensic use, although many of these will be found to be unsuitable for
      other reasons. However, from this data, we were able to identify 28 pairs
      of duplicated loci that were given separate DYS designations and four
      pairs of loci with overlapping flanking regions. Removing one locus from
      each set of duplicates reduced the number of potentially useful loci from
      417 to 389. The derived information should be useful for workers who are
      designing novel Y-STR multiplexes to ensure the presence of non-synonymous
      loci and, if so desired, to avoid loci that lie within structural genes.
      It may also be useful for forensic casework practitioners (or molecular
      anthropologists) to aid in distinguishing between chromosomal
      rearrangements (such as duplications and deletions) and bona fide DNA
      admixtures or null alleles caused by primer binding site mutations. We
      illustrate the practical usefulness of the chromosomal positioning data in
      the design of eight multiplex systems using 94 Y-STR loci.

TI  - Investigating the effects of prehistoric migrations in Siberia: genetic
      variation and the origins of Yakuts.
PG  - 334-53
AB  - The Yakuts (also known as Sakha), Turkic-speaking cattle- and
      horse-breeders, inhabit a vast territory in Central and northeastern
      Siberia. On the basis of the archaeological, ethnographic and linguistic
      evidence, they are assumed to have migrated north from their original area
      of settlement in the vicinity of Lake Baykal in South Siberia under the
      pressure of the Mongol expansion during the thirteenth to fifteenth
      century AD: . During their initial migration and subsequent expansion, the
      ancestors of the Yakuts settled in the territory originally occupied by
      Tungusic- and Uralic-speaking reindeer-herders and hunters. In this paper
      we use mtDNA and Y-chromosomal analyses to elucidate whether the Yakut
      immigration and expansion was accompanied by admixture with the indigenous
      populations of their new area of settlement or whether the Yakuts
      displaced the original inhabitants without intermarriage. The mtDNA
      results show a very close affinity of the Yakuts with Central Asian and
      South Siberian groups, which confirms their southern origin. There is no
      conclusive evidence for admixture with indigenous populations, though a
      small amount cannot be excluded on the basis of the mtDNA data alone. The
      Y-chromosomal results confirm previous findings of a very strong
      bottleneck in the Yakuts, the age of which is in good accordance with the
      hypothesis that the Yakuts migrated north under Mongol pressure.
      Furthermore, the genetic results show that the Yakuts are a very
      homogenous population, notwithstanding their current spread over a very
      large territory. This confirms the historical accounts that they spread
      over their current area of settlement fairly recently.

TI  - The geographic distribution of human Y chromosome variation.
PG  - 787-805
AB  - We examined variation on the nonrecombining portion of the human Y
      chromosome to investigate human evolution during the last 200,000 years.
      The Y-specific polymorphic sites included the Y Alu insertional
      polymorphism or "YAP" element (DYS287), the poly(A) tail associated with
      the YAP element, three point mutations in close association with the YAP
      insertion site, an A-G polymorphic transition (DYS271), and a
      tetranucleotide microsatellite (DYS19). Global variation at the five
      bi-allelic sites (DYS271, DYS287, and the three point mutations) gave rise
      to five "YAP haplotypes" in 60 populations from Africa, Europe, Asia,
      Australasia, and the New World (n = 1500). Combining the multi-allelic
      variation at the microsatellite loci (poly(A) tail and DYS19) with the YAP
      haplotypes resulted in a total of 27 "combination haplotypes". All five of
      the YAP haplotypes and 21 of the 27 combination haplotypes were found in
      African populations, which had greater haplotype diversity than did
      populations from other geographical locations. Only subsets of the five
      YAP haplotypes were found outside of Africa. Patterns of observed
      variation were compatible with a variety of hypotheses, including multiple
      human migrations and range expansions.
